Eysenck Personality Inventory (EPI) data for 3570 participants
--------------------------------------------------------------

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

The EPI is and has been a very frequently administered personality test
with 57 measuring two broad dimensions, Extraversion-Introversion and
Stability-Neuroticism, with an additional Lie scale. Developed by
Eysenck and Eysenck, 1964. Eventually replaced with the EPQ which
measures three broad dimensions. This data set represents 3570
observations collected in the early 1990s at the Personality, Motivation
and Cognition lab at Northwestern. The data are included here as
demonstration of scale construction.

Details
~~~~~~~

The original data were collected in a group testing framework for
screening participants for subsequent studies. The participants were
enrolled in an introductory psychology class between Fall, 1991 and
Spring, 1995.

The structure of the E scale has been shown by Rocklin and Revelle
(1981) to have two subcomponents, Impulsivity and Sociability. These
were subsequently used by Revelle, Humphreys, Simon and Gilliland to
examine the relationship between personality, caffeine induced arousal,
and cognitive performance.
