Details
~~~~~~~

hese items were collected as part of the SAPA project
(http://sapa-project.org)to develop online measures of ability (Revelle,
Wilt and Rosenthal, 2009). The score means are higher than national
norms suggesting both self selection for people taking on line
personality and ability tests and a self reporting bias in scores.
