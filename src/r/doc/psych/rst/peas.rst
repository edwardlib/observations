Galton's Peas
-------------

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

Francis Galton introduced the correlation coefficient with an analysis
of the similarities of the parent and child generation of 700 sweet
peas.

Usage
~~~~~

::

    data(peas)

Format
~~~~~~

A data frame with 700 observations on the following 2 variables.

``parent``
    The mean diameter of the mother pea for 700 peas

``child``
    The mean diameter of the daughter pea for 700 sweet peas

Details
~~~~~~~

Galton's introduction of the correlation coefficient was perhaps the
most important contribution to the study of individual differences. This
data set allows a graphical analysis of the data set. There are two
different graphic examples. One shows the regression lines for both
relationships, the other finds the correlation as well.
