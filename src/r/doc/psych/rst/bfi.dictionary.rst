25 Personality items representing 5 factors
-------------------------------------------

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

25 personality self report items taken from the International
Personality Item Pool (ipip.ori.org) were included as part of the
Synthetic Aperture Personality Assessment (SAPA) web based personality
assessment project. The data from 2800 subjects are included here as a
demonstration set for scale construction, factor analysis, and Item
Response Theory analysis. Three additional demographic variables (sex,
education, and age) are also included.

Usage

Details
~~~~~~~

The first 25 items are organized by five putative factors:
Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Neuroticism, and
Opennness. The scoring key is created using ``make.keys``, the scores
are found using ``score.items``.

These five factors are a useful example of using ``irt.fa`` to do Item
Response Theory based latent factor analysis of the ``polychoric``
correlation matrix. The endorsement plots for each item, as well as the
item information functions reveal that the items differ in their
quality.

The item data were collected using a 6 point response scale: 1 Very
Inaccurate 2 Moderately Inaccurate 3 Slightly Inaccurate 4 Slightly
Accurate 5 Moderately Accurate 6 Very Accurate

as part of the Synthetic Apeture Personality Assessment (SAPA
http://sapa-project.org) project. To see an example of the data
collection technique, visit http://SAPA-project.org. The items given
were sampled from the International Personality Item Pool of Lewis
Goldberg using the sampling technique of SAPA. This is a sample data set
taken from the much larger SAPA data bank.

Note
~~~~

The bfi data set and items should not be confused with the BFI (Big Five
Inventory) of Oliver John and colleagues (John, O. P., Donahue, E. M., &
Kentle, R. L. (1991). The Big Five Inventoryâ€“Versions 4a and 54.
Berkeley, CA: University of California,Berkeley, Institute of
Personality and Social Research.)
