Tuna Sighting Data
------------------

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``tuna`` data frame has 64 rows and 1 columns.

The data come from an aerial line transect survey of Southern Bluefin
Tuna in the Great Australian Bight. An aircraft with two spotters on
board flies randomly allocated line transects. Each school of tuna
sighted is counted and its perpendicular distance from the transect
measured. The survey was conducted in summer when tuna tend to stay on
the surface.

Usage

This data frame contains the following column:

``y``
    The perpendicular distance, in miles, from the transect for 64
    independent sightings of tuna schools.
