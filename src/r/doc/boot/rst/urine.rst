Urine Analysis Data
-------------------

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``urine`` data frame has 79 rows and 7 columns.

79 urine specimens were analyzed in an effort to determine if certain
physical characteristics of the urine might be related to the formation
of calcium oxalate crystals.

Usage
~~~~~

::

    urine

Format
~~~~~~

This data frame contains the following columns:

``r``
    Indicator of the presence of calcium oxalate crystals.

``gravity``
    The specific gravity of the urine.

``ph``
    The pH reading of the urine.

``osmo``
    The osmolarity of the urine. Osmolarity is proportional to the
    concentration of molecules in solution.

``cond``
    The conductivity of the urine. Conductivity is proportional to the
    concentration of charged ions in solution.

``urea``
    The urea concentration in millimoles per litre.

``calc``
    The calcium concentration in millimoles per litre.
