Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``cane`` data frame has 180 rows and 5 columns. The data frame
represents a randomized block design with 45 varieties of sugar-cane and
4 blocks.

Usage
~~~~~

::

    cane

Format
~~~~~~

This data frame contains the following columns:

``n``
    The total number of shoots in each plot.

``r``
    The number of diseased shoots.

``x``
    The number of pieces of the stems, out of 50, planted in each plot.

``var``
    A factor indicating the variety of sugar-cane in each plot.

``block``
    A factor for the blocks.

Details
~~~~~~~

The aim of the experiment was to classify the varieties into resistant,
intermediate and susceptible to a disease called "coal of sugar-cane"
(carvao da cana-de-acucar). This is a disease that is common in
sugar-cane plantations in certain areas of Brazil.

For each plot, fifty pieces of sugar-cane stem were put in a solution
containing the disease agent and then some were planted in the plot.
After a fixed period of time, the total number of shoots and the number
of diseased shoots were recorded.
