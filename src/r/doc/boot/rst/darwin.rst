Darwin's Plant Height Differences
---------------------------------

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``darwin`` data frame has 15 rows and 1 columns.

Charles Darwin conducted an experiment to examine the superiority of
cross-fertilized plants over self-fertilized plants. 15 pairs of plants
were used. Each pair consisted of one cross-fertilized plant and one
self-fertilized plant which germinated at the same time and grew in the
same pot. The plants were measured at a fixed time after planting and
the difference in heights between the cross- and self-fertilized plants
are recorded in eighths of an inch.
