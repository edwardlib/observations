Spatial Location of Bramble Canes
---------------------------------

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``brambles`` data frame has 823 rows and 3 columns.

The location of living bramble canes in a 9m square plot was recorded.
We take 9m to be the unit of distance so that the plot can be thought of
as a unit square. The bramble canes were also classified by their age.

Usage
~~~~~

::

    brambles

Format
~~~~~~

This data frame contains the following columns:

``x``
    The x coordinate of the position of the cane in the plot.

``y``
    The y coordinate of the position of the cane in the plot.

``age``
    The age classification of the canes; ``0`` indicates a newly emerged
    cane, ``1`` indicates a one year old cane and ``2`` indicates a two
    year old cane.
