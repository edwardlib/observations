Failures of Air-conditioning Equipment
--------------------------------------

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

Proschan (1963) reported on the times between failures of the
air-conditioning equipment in 10 Boeing 720 aircraft. The ``aircondit``
data frame contains the intervals for the ninth aircraft while
``aircondit7`` contains those for the seventh aircraft.

Both data frames have just one column. Note that the data have been
sorted into increasing order.

Usage
~~~~~

The data frames contain the following column:

``hours``
    The time interval in hours between successive failures of the
    air-conditioning equipment
