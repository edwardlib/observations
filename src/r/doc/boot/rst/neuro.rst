Neurophysiological Point Process Data
-------------------------------------

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

``neuro`` is a matrix containing times of observed firing of a neuron in
windows of 250ms either side of the application of a stimulus to a human
subject. Each row of the matrix is a replication of the experiment and
there were a total of 469 replicates.

Note
~~~~

There are a lot of missing values in the matrix as different numbers of
firings were observed in different replicates. The number of firings
observed varied from 2 to 6.

The data were collected and kindly made available by Dr. S.J. Boniface
of the Neurophysiology Unit at the Radcliffe Infirmary, Oxford.
