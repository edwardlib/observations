Australian Relative Wool Prices
-------------------------------

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

``wool`` is a time series of class ``"ts"`` and contains 309
observations.

Each week that the market is open the Australian Wool Corporation set a
floor price which determines their policy on intervention and is
therefore a reflection of the overall price of wool for the week in
question. Actual prices paid can vary considerably about the floor
price. The series here is the log of the ratio between the price for
fine grade wool and the floor price, each market week between July 1976
and Jun 1984.
