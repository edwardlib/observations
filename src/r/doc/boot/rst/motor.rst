Data from a Simulated Motorcycle Accident
-----------------------------------------

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``motor`` data frame has 94 rows and 4 columns. The rows are
obtained by removing replicate values of ``time`` from the dataset
``mcycle``. Two extra columns are added to allow for strata with a
different residual variance in each stratum.

Usage
~~~~~

::

    motor

Format
~~~~~~

This data frame contains the following columns:

``times``
    The time in milliseconds since impact.

``accel``
    The recorded head acceleration (in g).

``strata``
    A numeric column indicating to which of the three strata (numbered
    1, 2 and 3) the observations belong.

``v``
    An estimate of the residual variance for the observation. ``v`` is
    constant within the strata but a different estimate is used for each
    of the three strata.
