Calcium Uptake Data
-------------------

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``calcium`` data frame has 27 rows and 2 columns.

Howard Grimes from the Botany Department, North Carolina State
University, conducted an experiment for biochemical analysis of
intracellular storage and transport of calcium across plasma membrane.
Cells were suspended in a solution of radioactive calcium for a certain
length of time and then the amount of radioactive calcium that was
absorbed by the cells was measured. The experiment was repeated
independently with 9 different times of suspension each replicated 3
times.

Usage
~~~~~

::

    calcium

Format
~~~~~~

This data frame contains the following columns:

``time``
    The time (in minutes) that the cells were suspended in the solution.

``cal``
    The amount of calcium uptake (nmoles/mg).
