----------------

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

Percentage incidence of the 13 characteristics of water voles in 14
areas.

Usage

::

    data("watervoles")

Format
~~~~~~

A dissimilarity matrix for the following 14 variables, i.e, areas:
``Surrey``, ``Shropshire``, ``Yorkshire``, ``Perthshire``, ``Aberdeen``,
``Elean Gamhna``, ``Alps``, ``Yugoslavia``, ``Germany``, ``Norway``,
``Pyrenees I``, ``Pyrenees II``, ``North Spain``, and ``South Spain``.

Details
~~~~~~~

Corbet et al. (1970) report a study of water voles (genus Arvicola) in
which the aim was to compare British populations of these animals with
those in Europe, to investigate whether more than one species might be
present in Britain. The original data consisted of observations of the
presence or absence of 13 characteristics in about 300 water vole skulls
arising from six British populations and eight populations from the rest
of Europe. The data are the percentage incidence of the 13
characteristics in each of the 14 samples of water vole skulls.
