Details
~~~~~~~

Cars were selected at random from among 1993 passenger car models that
were listed in both the *Consumer Reports* issue and the *PACE Buying
Guide*. Pickup trucks and Sport/Utility vehicles were eliminated due to
incomplete information in the *Consumer Reports* source. Duplicate
models (e.g., Dodge Shadow and Plymouth Sundance) were listed at most
once.

Further description can be found in Lock (1993).
