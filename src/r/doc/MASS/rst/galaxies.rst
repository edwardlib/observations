Velocities for 82 Galaxies
--------------------------

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

A numeric vector of velocities in km/sec of 82 galaxies from 6
well-separated conic sections of an ``unfilled`` survey of the Corona
Borealis region. Multimodality in such surveys is evidence for voids and
superclusters in the far universe.

Usage
~~~~~

::

    galaxies

Note
~~~~

There is an 83rd measurement of 5607 km/sec in the Postman *et al.*
paper which is omitted in Roeder (1990) and from the dataset here.

There is also a typo: this dataset has 78th observation 26690 which
should be 26960.
