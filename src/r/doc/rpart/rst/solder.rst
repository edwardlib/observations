Soldering of Components on Printed-Circuit Boards
-------------------------------------------------

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``solder`` data frame has 720 rows and 6 columns, representing a
balanced subset of a designed experiment varying 5 factors on the
soldering of components on printed-circuit boards.

Usage
~~~~~

::

    solder

Format
~~~~~~

This data frame contains the following columns:

``Opening``
    a factor with levels L, M and S indicating the amount of clearance
    around the mounting pad.

``Solder``
    a factor with levels Thick and Thin giving the thickness of the
    solder used.

``Mask``
    a factor with levels A1.5, A3, B3 and B6 indicating the type and
    thickness of mask used.

``PadType``
    a factor with levels D4, D6, D7, L4, L6, L7, L8, L9, W4 and W9
    giving the size and geometry of the mounting pad.

``Panel``
    ``1:3`` indicating the panel on a board being tested.

``skips``
    a numeric vector giving the number of visible solder skips.
