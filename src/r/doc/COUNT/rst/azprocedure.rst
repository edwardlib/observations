azprocedure
-----------

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

Data come from the 1991 Arizona cardiovascular patient files. A subset
of the fields was selected to model the differential length of stay for
patients entering the hospital to receive one of two standard
cardiovascular procedures: CABG and PTCA. CABG is the standard acronym
for Coronary Artery Bypass Graft, where the flow of blood in a diseased
or blocked coronary artery or vein has been grafted to bypass the
diseased sections. PTCA, or Percutaneous Transluminal Coronary
Angioplasty, is a method of placing a balloon in a blocked coronary
artery to open it to blood flow. It is a much less severe method of
treatment for those having coronary blockage, with a corresponding
reduction in risk.

Usage
~~~~~

::

    data(azprocedure)

Format
~~~~~~

A data frame with 3589 observations on the following 6 variables.

``los``
    length of hospital stay

``procedure``
    1=CABG;0=PTCA

``sex``
    1=Male; 0=female

``admit``
    1=Urgent/Emerg; 0=elective (type of admission)

``age75``
    1= Age>75; 0=Age<=75

``hospital``
    encrypted facility code (string)

Details
~~~~~~~

azprocedure is saved as a data frame. Count models use los as response
variable. 0 counts are structurally excluded

::

    library(MASS)
    library(msme)

    data(azprocedure)

    glmazp <- glm(los ~ procedure + sex + admit, family=poisson, data=azprocedure)
    summary(glmazp)
    exp(coef(glmazp))

    nb2 <- nbinomial(los ~ procedure + sex + admit, data=azprocedure)
    summary(nb2)
    exp(coef(nb2))

    glmaznb <- glm.nb(los ~ procedure + sex + admit, data=azprocedure)
    summary(glmaznb)
