Experimenter Expectations
-------------------------

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``Adler`` data frame has 97 rows and 3 columns.

The “experimenters” were the actual subjects of the study. They
collected ratings of the apparent successfulness of people in pictures
who were pre-selected for their average appearance. The experimenters
were told prior to collecting data that the pictures were either high or
low in their appearance of success, and were instructed to get good
data, scientific data, or were given no such instruction. Each
experimenter collected ratings from 18 randomly assigned respondents; a
few subjects were deleted at random to produce an unbalanced design.
