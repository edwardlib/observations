The data consist of headache logs kept by 133 patients in a treatment
program in which bio-feedback was used to attempt to reduce migraine
frequency and severity. Patients entered the program at different times
over a period of about 3 years. Patients were encouraged to begin their
logs four weeks before the onset of treatment and to continue for one
month afterwards, but only 55 patients have data preceding the onset of
treatment.
