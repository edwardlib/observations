Details

The Titanic was a British luxury ocean liner that sank famously in the
icy North Atlantic on its maiden voyage in April of 1912. Of the
approximately 2200 passengers on board, 1500 died. The high death rate
was blamed largely on the inadequate supply of lifeboats, a result of
the manufacturer's claim that the ship was "unsinkable." A partial data
set of the passenger list was compiled by Philip Hinde in his
Encyclopedia Titanica and is given in this dataset.
