Details
~~~~~~~

Two students, Lara and Lisa, conducted an experiment to compare Orville
Redenbacher's Light Butter Flavor vs. Seaway microwave popcorn. They
made 12 batches of popcorn, 6 of each type, cooking each batch for four
minutes. They noted that the microwave oven seemed to get warmer as they
went along so they kept track of six trials and randomly chose which
brand would go first for each trial. For a response variable they
counted the number of unpopped kernels and then adjusted the count for
Seaway for having more ounces per bag of popcorn (3.5 vs 3.0).
