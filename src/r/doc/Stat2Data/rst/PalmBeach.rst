Details
~~~~~~~

The race for the presidency of the United States in the fall of 2000 was
very close, with the electoral votes from Florida determining the
outcome. In the disputed final tally in Florida, George W. Bush won by
just 537 votes over Al Gore, out of almost 6 million votes cast. About
2.3 were awarded to other candidates. One of those other candidates was
Pat Buchanan, who did much better in Palm Beach County than he did
anywhere else. Palm Beach County used a unique "butterfly ballot" that
had candidate names on either side of the page with "chads" to be
punched in the middle. This non-standard ballot seemed to confuse some
voters, who punched votes for Buchanan that may have been intended for a
different candidate. This dataset shows the number of votes for Bush and
Buchanan in each Florida county.
