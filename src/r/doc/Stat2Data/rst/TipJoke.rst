Can telling a joke affect whether or not a waiter in a coffee bar
receives a tip from a customer? A study investigated this question at a
coffee bar at a famous resort on the west coast of France. The waiter
randomly assigned coffee-ordering customers to one of three groups: When
receiving the bill one group also received a card telling a joke,
another group received a card containing an advertisement for a local
restaurant, and a third group received no card at all. He recorded
whether or not each customer left a tip.
