Details
~~~~~~~

This dataset contains information for a sample of 200 patients who were
part of a larger study conducted in a hospital's Intensive Care Unit
(ICU). Since an ICU often deals with serious, life-threatening cases, a
key variable to study is patient survival, which is coded in the Survive
variable as 1 if the patient lived to be discharged and 0 if the patient
died.
