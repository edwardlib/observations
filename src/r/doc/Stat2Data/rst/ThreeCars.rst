Details
~~~~~~~

Two students collected samples of Porsche, Jaguar, and BMW cars that
were offered for sale at an internet site. In addition to asking price,
they recorded the model year (converting to age) and mileage of each
advertised car. The PorschePrice dataset has only the Porsche data and
the PorscheJaguar dataset has the data for those two models.
