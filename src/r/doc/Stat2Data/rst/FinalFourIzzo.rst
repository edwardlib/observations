Details
~~~~~~~

Each year 64 college teams are selected for the NCAA Division I Men's
Basketball tournament, with 16 teams placed in each of four regions.
Within each region the teams are seeded from 1 to 16, with the
(presumed) best team as the 1 seed and the (presumed) weakest team as
the 16 seed; this practice of seeding teams began in 1979 for the NCAA
tournament. Only one team from each region (so four teams each year)
advances to the Final Four. This dataset if is the same as
FinalFourLong, except the data starts in 1985 and we have a extra column
that is an indicator for Michigan State teams coached by Tom Izzo.
