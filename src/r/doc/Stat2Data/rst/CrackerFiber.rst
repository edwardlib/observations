Twelve female subjects were fed a controlled diet, with crackers before

fiber, gum fiber, and a combination of both bran and gum fiber. Over the
course of the study, each subject ate all four kinds of crackers, one

The response is the number of digested calories, measured as the
difference between calories eaten and calories passed through the
system.
