An article in the New England Journal of Medicine described a study on
the effectiveness of medications for combatting nausea in patients
undergoing chemotherapy treatments for cancer. In the experiment, 157
patients were divided at random into two groups. One group of 78
patients were given a standard antinausea drug called prochlorperazine,
while the other group of 79 patients received THC (the active ingredient
in marijuana). Both medications were delivered orally and no patients
were told which of the two drugs they were taking. The response measured
was whether or not the patient experienced relief from nausea when
undergoing chemotherapy. Dataset is a 2x2 table of counts.
