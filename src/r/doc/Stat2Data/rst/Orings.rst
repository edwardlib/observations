Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

Number of damaged O-rings on space shuttle launches and launch
temperature

Format
~~~~~~

A dataset with 24 observations on the following 2 variables.

``Temp``

Code for temperature (in degrees F): ``Above65`` ``Below65``

``Failures``

Number of O-ring failures

Details
~~~~~~~

The space shuttle Challenger explodes shortly after liftoff in 1987. The
subsequent investigation focused on the failure of O-ring seals, which
allowed liquid hydrogen and oxygen to mix and explode. These failures
might be related to temperature at the launch site which was near
freezing (32 degrees F) on that day. This dataset shows the number of
O-ring failures on previous shuttle launches, along with an indicator
for whether the temperature was above or below 65 degrees F.
