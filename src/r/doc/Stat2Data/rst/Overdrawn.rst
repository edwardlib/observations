Researchers conducted a survey of 450 undergraduates in large
introductory courses at either Mississippi State University or the
University of Mississippi. There were close to 150 questions on the
survey, but only four of these variables are included in this dataset.
(You can consult the paper to learn how the variables beyond these 4
affect the analysis.) The primary interest for the researchers was
factors relating to whether or not a student has ever overdrawn a
checking account.
