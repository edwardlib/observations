Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

Calcium and blood pressure

Format
~~~~~~

A dataset with 21 observations on the following 2 variables.

``Treatment``

``Calcium`` or ``Placebo``

``Decrease``

Beginning-ending blood pressure

Details
~~~~~~~

The purpose of this study was to see whether daily calcium supplements
can lower blood pressure. The subjects were 21 men; each was randomly
assigned either to a treatment group or to a control group. Those in the
treatment group took a daily pill containing calcium. Those in the
control group took a daily pill with no active ingredients. Each
subject's blood pressure was measured at the beginning of the 12-week
study, and again at the end. The decrease in blood pressure (begin-end)
was recorded (so a negative value means blood pressure increased).
