Forty-six mountains in the Adirondacks of upstate New York are known as
the High Peaks with elevations near or above 4000 feet (although modern
measurements show a couple of the peaks are actually slightly under 4000
feet). A goal for hikers in the region is to become a "46er" by scaling
each of these peaks. This dataset give infomation about the hiking
trails up each of these peaks.
