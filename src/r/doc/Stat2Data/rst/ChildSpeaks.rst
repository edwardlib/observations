These data were originally collected by L.M. Linde of UCLA but were
first published by M.R. Mickey, O.J. Dunn, and V. Clark, "Note on the
use of stepwise regression in detecting outliers," Computers and
Biomedical Research, 1 (1967), pp. 105-111. The data have been used by
several authors. We found them in David Moore's Basic Practice of
Statistics, WH Freeman (2004)
