Details
~~~~~~~

Hanley and Shapiro (1994) report on a study conducted by Partridge and
Farquhar (1981) about the sexual behavior of fruit flies. It was already
known that increased reproduction leads to shorter life spans for female
fruit flies. But the question remained whether an increase in sexual
activity would also reduce the life spans of male fruit flies. The
researchers designed an experiment to answer this question. They had a
total of 125 male fruit flies to use and they randomly assigned each of
the 125 to one of the following five groups.
