Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

Format
~~~~~~

A dataset with 2 observations on the following 4 variables.

``Group``

``Yes``

Count of number of patients that were pain-free

``No``

Details
~~~~~~~

A study investigated whether a handheld device that sends a magnetic
pulse into a person's head might be an effective treatment for migraine
headaches. Researchers recruited 200 subjects who suffered from
migraines and randomly assigned them to receive either the TMS
(transcranial magnetic stimulation) treatment or a sham (placebo)
treatment from a device that did not deliver any stimulation. Subjects
were instructed to apply the device at the onset of migraine symptoms
and then assess how they felt two hours later. This dataset is a two-way
table of the results.
