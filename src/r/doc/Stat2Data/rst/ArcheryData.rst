In 2002, Heather Tollerud, a Saint Olaf College student, undertook a
study of the archery scores of students at the college who were enrolled
in an archery course. Students taking the course record a score for each
day they attend class from the first until the last day. Hopefully the
instruction they receive helps them to improve their game.
