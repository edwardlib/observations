River Iron
----------

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

Amounts of iron in water samples of four rivers

Format
~~~~~~

A dataset with 12 observations on the following 4 variables.

``River``

One of four rivers: ``Grasse``, ``Oswegatchie``, ``Raquette``, or
``St. Regis``

``Site``

Location of the site: ``DownStream``, ``MidStream`` or ``Upstream``

``Iron``

Iron concentration in the water sample (parts per million)

``LogIron``

Log (base 10) of iron concentration

Details
~~~~~~~

Some geologists were interested in the water chemistry of rivers in
upstate New York. They took water samples at three different locations
in four rivers (Grasse, Oswegatchie, Raquette, and St. Regis). The
sampling sites were chosen to investigate how the composition of the
water changes as it flows from the source to the mouth of each river.
The sampling sites were labeled as upstream, midstream, and downstream.
This dataset contains the concentations of iron in the samples. The
dataset RiverElements has similar concentration data for many other
elements.
