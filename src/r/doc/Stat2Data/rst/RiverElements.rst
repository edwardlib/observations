Details
~~~~~~~

Some geologists were interested in the water chemistry of rivers in
upstate New York. They took water samples at three different locations
in four rivers (Grasse, Oswegatchie, Raquette, and St. Regis). The
sampling sites were chosen to investigate how the composition of the
water changes as it flows from the source to the mouth of each river.
The sampling sites were labeled as upstream, midstream, and downstream.
This dataset contains the concentations (parts per million) of a variety
of elements in thoise water samples. The dataset RiverIron contains the
information for iorn (FE) alone, along with the log of the
concentration.
