Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

Ethanol

Format
~~~~~~

A dataset with 16 observations on the following 3 variables.

``Sugar``

Type of sugar: ``Galactose`` or ``Glucose``

``O2Conc``

Oxygen concentration

``Ethanol``

Ethanol concentration

Details
~~~~~~~

Many biochemical reactions are slowed or prevented by the presence of
oxygen. For example, there are two simple forms of fermentation, one
which converts each molecule of sugar to two molecules of lactic acid,
and a second which converts each molecule of sugar to one each of lactic
acid, ethanol, and carbon dioxide. This experiment was designed to
compare the inhibiting effect of oxygen on the metabolism of two
different sugars, glucose and galactose, by Streptococcus bacteria. In
this case there were four levels of oxygen that were applied to the two
kinds of sugar.
