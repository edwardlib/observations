In recent years many colleges have re-examined the traditional role the
scores on the Scholastic Aptitude Tests (SAT's) play in making decisions
on which students to admit. Do SAT scores really help predict success in
college? To investigate this question a group of 24 introductory
statistics students supplied the data in this dataset showing their
score on the Verbal portion of the SAT as well as their current grade
point average (GPA) on a 0.0-4.0 scale.
