Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

Body size and metabolic rate of Manduca Sexta caterpillars

Format
~~~~~~

A dataset with 305 observations on the following 7 variables.

``Computer``

ID number of the computer used to measure metabolic rate

``BodySize``

Size of the caterpillar (in grams)

``LogBodySize``

Log (base 10) of BodySize

``Instar``

Number from 1 (smallest) to 5 (largest) indicating stage of the
caterpillar's life

``CO2ppm``

Carbon dioxide concentration (in ppm)

``Mrate``

Metabolic rate

``LogMrate``

Log (base 10) of metablic rate
