Putts2
------

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

Putting results for a golfing statistician (by length of the putts)

Format
~~~~~~

A dataset with 5 observations on the following 4 variables.

``Length``

Length of the attempted putt (in feet)

``Made``

Number of putts made at this length

``Missed``

Number of putts missed at this length

``Trials``

Total number of putts attempted at this length

Details
~~~~~~~

A statistician golfer kept careful records of every putt he attempted
when playing golf, recording the length of the putt and whether or not
he was successful in making the putt. For each different length, this
dataset records the number putts made, missed, and the total number of
attempts from that length. A similar dataset, Putts1, has one case for
each of the 587 attempted putts, showing the length and outcome.
