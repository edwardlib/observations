Details
~~~~~~~

Grocery stores and product manufacturers are always interested in how
well the products on the store shelves sell. An experiment was designed
to test whether the amount of discount given on products affected the
amount of sales of that product. There were three levels of discount,
5%, 10%, and 15%, and sales were held for a week. The total number of
products sold during the week of the sale was recorded. The researchers
also recorded the wholesale price of the item put on sale.
