-------------------

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

An experiment to see if financial incentives improve weight loss

Format
~~~~~~

A dataset with 38 observations on the following 3 variables.

``WeightLoss``

Weight loss (in pounds) after four months

``Group``

Treatment group: ``Control`` or ``Incentive``

``Month7Loss``

Details
~~~~~~~

| Researchers investigated whether financial incentives would help
  people lose weight more successfully. Some participants in the study
  were randomly assigned to a treatment group that was offered financial
  incentives for achieving weight loss goals, while others were assigned
  to a control group that did not use financial incentives. All
  participants were monitored over a four month period and the net
  weight change (Before - After in pounds) at the end of this period was
  recorded for each individual. Then the individuals were left alone for
  three months with a followup weight check at the seven-month mark to
  see whether weight losses persisted after the original four months of
  treatment.
| The 4-month data alone (with missing values omitted) is stored in
  WeightLossIncentive4.
| The 7-month data alone (with missing values omitted) is stored in
  WeightLossIncentive7.
