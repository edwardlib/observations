Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

HearingTest

Format
~~~~~~

A dataset with 96 observations on the following 3 variables.

``Subj``

Subject number (1 - 24)

``List``

List of words: ``L1`` ``L2`` ``L3`` ``L4``

``Percent``

Percent (out of 50) of words correctly identified

Details
~~~~~~~

Audiologists use standard lists of 50 words to test hearing; the words
are calibrated, using subjects with normal hearing, to make all 50 words
on the list equally hard to hear. The goal of the study described here
was to see how four such lists, denoted by L1-L4 in this dataset,
compared when played at low volume with a noisy background. The response
is the percentage of words identified correctly.
