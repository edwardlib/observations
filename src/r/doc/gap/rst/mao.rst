A study of Parkinson's disease and MAO gene
-------------------------------------------

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

The markers are both with actual allele sizes and allele numbers. The
dataset is distributed with the GENECOUNTING version 2.0 illustrating
gene counting method involving chromosome X. A total of 183 patients and
157 controls (150 males, 190 females) were available, together with five
markers in MAOA (monoamine oxidase A) region with alleles 12, 9, 6, 5,
3, and the first three markers were genotyped in all individuals while
the fourth and fifth were genotyped for 294 and 304 individuals.
