Example Data for the Crossover Encouragement Design
---------------------------------------------------

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

A randomly generated dataset containing 2000 rows and 7 columns with no
missing values.

Usage
~~~~~

::

    CEDdata

Format
~~~~~~

A data frame containing the following variables, which are interpreted
as results from a hypothetical randomized trial employing the crossover
encouragement design.

T1:
    The binary treatment indicator in the first stage.

M1:
    The binary mediator variable recorded in the first stage.

Y1:
    The binary outcome variable recorded in the first stage.

T2:
    The binary treatment in the second stage. Equal to 1 - T1 by design.

Z:
    The binary encouragement indicator for the second stage.

M2:
    The binary mediator recorded in the second stage.

Y2:
    The binary outcome recorded in the second stage.

Details
~~~~~~~

Note that all the observed responses are generated from an underlying
distribution of potential outcomes and mediators (not shown in this
dataset) satisfying the assumptions described in Imai, Tingley and
Yamamoto (2012).
