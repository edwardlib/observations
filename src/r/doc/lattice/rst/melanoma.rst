Melanoma skin cancer incidence
------------------------------

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

These data from the Connecticut Tumor Registry present age-adjusted
numbers of melanoma skin-cancer incidences per 100,000 people in
Connectict for the years from 1936 to 1972.

Usage
~~~~~

::

    melanoma

Format
~~~~~~

A data frame with 37 observations on the following 2 variables.

year
    Years 1936 to 1972.

incidence
    Rate of melanoma cancer per 100,000 population.

Note
~~~~

This dataset is not related to the ``melanoma`` dataset in the **boot**
package with the same name.

The S-PLUS 6.2 help for the melanoma data says that the incidence rate
is per *million*, but this is not consistent with data found at the
National Cancer Institute (http://www.nci.nih.gov).
