Reaction times in a sleep deprivation study
-------------------------------------------

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

The average reaction time per day for subjects in a sleep deprivation
study. On day 0 the subjects had their normal amount of sleep. Starting
that night they were restricted to 3 hours of sleep per night. The
observations represent the average reaction time on a series of tests
given each day to each subject.

Format
~~~~~~

A data frame with 180 observations on the following 3 variables.

``Reaction``
    Average reaction time (ms)

``Days``
    Number of days of sleep deprivation

``Subject``
    Subject number on which the observation was made.

Details
~~~~~~~

These data are from the study described in Belenky et al. (2003), for
the sleep-deprived group and for the first 10 days of the study, up to
the recovery period.

           xlab = "Days of sleep deprivation",
           ylab = "Average reaction time (ms)", aspect = "xy")
    (fm1 <- lmer(Reaction ~ Days + (Days|Subject), sleepstudy))
    (fm2 <- lmer(Reaction ~ Days + (1|Subject) + (0+Days|Subject), sleepstudy))
