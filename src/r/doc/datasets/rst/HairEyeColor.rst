Details

The Hair *x* Eye table comes rom a survey of students at the University
of Delaware reported by Snee (1974). The split by ``Sex`` was added by
Friendly (1992a) for didactic purposes.

This data set is useful for illustrating various techniques for the
analysis of contingency tables, such as the standard chi-squared test
or, more generally, log-linear modelling, and graphical methods such as
mosaic plots, sieve diagrams or association plots.

Snee (1974) gives the two-way table aggregated over ``Sex``. The ``Sex``
split of the ‘Brown hair, Brown eye’ cell was changed to agree with that
used by Friendly (2000).
