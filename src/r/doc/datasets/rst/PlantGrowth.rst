------------------------------------------

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

Results from an experiment to compare yields (as measured by dried
weight of plants) obtained under a control and two different treatment
conditions.

Usage
~~~~~

::

    PlantGrowth

Format
~~~~~~

A data frame of 30 cases on 2 variables.

+---------+----------+-----------+
| [, 1]   | weight   | numeric   |

    ## One factor ANOVA example from Dobson's book, cf. Table 7.4:
    require(stats); require(graphics)
    boxplot(weight ~ group, data = PlantGrowth, main = "PlantGrowth data",
            ylab = "Dried weight of plants", col = "lightgray",
            notch = TRUE, varwidth = TRUE)
    anova(lm(weight ~ group, data = PlantGrowth))
