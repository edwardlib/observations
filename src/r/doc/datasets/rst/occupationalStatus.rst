::

    require(stats); require(graphics)

    plot(occupationalStatus)

    ##  Fit a uniform association model separating diagonal effects
    Diag <- as.factor(diag(1:8))
    Rscore <- scale(as.numeric(row(occupationalStatus)), scale = FALSE)
    Cscore <- scale(as.numeric(col(occupationalStatus)), scale = FALSE)
    modUnif <- glm(Freq ~ origin + destination + Diag + Rscore:Cscore,
                   family = poisson, data = occupationalStatus)

    summary(modUnif)
    plot(modUnif) # 4 plots, with warning about  h_ii ~= 1
