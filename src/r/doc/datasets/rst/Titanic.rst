Details
~~~~~~~

The sinking of the Titanic is a famous event, and new books are still
being published about it. Many well-known facts—from the proportions of
first-class passengers to the ‘women and children first’ policy, and the
fact that that policy was not entirely successful in saving the women
and children in the third class—are reflected in the survival rates for
various classes of passenger.

These data were originally collected by the British Board of Trade in
their investigation of the sinking. Note that there is not complete
agreement among primary sources as to the exact numbers on board,
rescued, or lost.

Due in particular to the very successful film ‘Titanic’, the last years
saw a rise in public interest in the Titanic. Very detailed data about
the passengers is now available on the Internet, at sites such as
*Encyclopedia Titanica* (http://www.rmplc.co.uk/eduweb/sites/phind).
