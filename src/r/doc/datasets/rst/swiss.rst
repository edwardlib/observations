Details
~~~~~~~

(paraphrasing Mosteller and Tukey):

Switzerland, in 1888, was entering a period known as the *demographic
transition*; i.e., its fertility was beginning to fall from the high
level typical of underdeveloped countries.

The data collected are for 47 French-speaking “provinces” at about 1888.

Here, all variables are scaled to *[0, 100]*, where in the original, all
but ``"Catholic"`` were scaled to *[0, 1]*.

Note
~~~~

Files for all 182 districts in 1888 and other years have been available
at https://opr.princeton.edu/archive/pefp/switz.aspx.

They state that variables ``Examination`` and ``Education`` are averages
for 1887, 1888 and 1889.
