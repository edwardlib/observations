Classical N, P, K Factorial Experiment
--------------------------------------

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

A classical N, P, K (nitrogen, phosphate, potassium) factorial
experiment on the growth of peas conducted on 6 blocks. Each half of a
fractional factorial design confounding the NPK interaction was used on
3 of the plots.

Usage
~~~~~

::

    npk

Format
~~~~~~

The ``npk`` data frame has 24 rows and 5 columns:

``block``
    which block (label 1 to 6).

``N``
    indicator (0/1) for the application of nitrogen.

``P``
    indicator (0/1) for the application of phosphate.

``K``
    indicator (0/1) for the application of potassium.

``yield``
    Yield of peas, in pounds/plot (the plots were (1/70) acre).
