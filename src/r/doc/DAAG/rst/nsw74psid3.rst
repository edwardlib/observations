Labour Training Evaluation Data
-------------------------------

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

These data are pertinent to an investigation of the way that earnings
changed, between 1974-1975 and 1978, in the absence of training. The
data frame combines data for the experimental treatment group (NSW, 185
observations), using as control data results from the PSID (Panel Study
of Income Dynamics) study (128 observations). The latter were chosen to
mimic the characteristics of the NSW training and control groups. These
are a subset of the ``nsw74psid1`` data.
