Data are total available pure alcohol content, for the three categories,
divided by numbers of persons aged 15 years or more. The source data for
New Zealand included quarterly figures from December 1997, and annual
data to December for all years. The annual New Zealand figure to June
1998 required an estimate for September 1997 that was obtained by
extrapolating back the third quarter trend line from later years.
