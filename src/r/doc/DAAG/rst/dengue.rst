Dengue prevalence, by administrative region
-------------------------------------------

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

Data record, for each of 2000 administrative regions, whether or not
dengue was recorded at any time between 1961 and 1990.

Usage
~~~~~

::

    data(dengue)

Format
~~~~~~

A data frame with 2000 observations on the following 13 variables.

humid
    Average vapour density: 1961-1990

humid90
    90th percentile of ``humid``

temp
    Average temperature: 1961-1990

temp90
    90th percentile of ``temp``

h10pix
    maximum of ``humid``, within a 10 pixel radius

h10pix90
    maximum of ``humid90``, within a 10 pixel radius

trees
    Percent tree cover, from satellite data

trees90
    90th percentile of ``trees``

NoYes
    Was dengue observed? (1=yes)

Xmin
    minimum longitude

Xmax
    maximum longitude

Ymin
    minimum latitude

Ymax
    maximum latitude

Details
~~~~~~~

This is derived from a data set in which the climate and tree cover
information were given for each half degree of latitude by half degreee
of longitude pixel. The variable ``NoYes`` was given by administrative
region. The climate data and tree cover data given here are 50th or 90th
percentiles, where percetiles were calculates across pixels for an
administrative region.
