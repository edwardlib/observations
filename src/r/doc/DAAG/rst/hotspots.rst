Hawaian island chain hotspot Potassium-Argon ages
-------------------------------------------------

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

K-Ar Ages (millions of years) and distances (km) from Kilauea along the
trend of the chain of Hawaian volcanic islands and other seamounts that
are believed to have been created by a moving "hot spot". The age of
Kilauea is given as 0-0.4 Ma.

Usage
~~~~~

::

    data(hotspots)

Format
~~~~~~

A data frame with 36 observations on the following 6 variables.

``ID``

``name``
    Name

``distance``
    Distance in kilometers

``age``
    K-Ar age in millions of years

``error``
    Standard error of estimate?

``source``
