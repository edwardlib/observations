    plot(log(Time) ~ log(Distance), data=progression)
    xyplot(log(Time) ~ log(Distance), data=progression, type=c("p","r"))
    xyplot(log(Time) ~ log(Distance), data=progression,
           type=c("p","smooth"))
    res <- resid(lm(log(Time) ~ log(Distance), data=progression))
    plot(res ~ log(Distance), data=progression,
