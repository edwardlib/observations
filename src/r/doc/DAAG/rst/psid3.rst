-------------------------------

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

A non-experimental "control" group, used in various studies of the
effect of a labor training program, alternative to the experimental
control group in ``nswdemo``.

Usage
~~~~~

Details
~~~~~~~

The ``cps1`` and ``psid1`` data sets are two non-experimental "control"
groups, alternative to that in ``nswdemo``, used in investigating
whether use of such a non-experimental control group can be
satisfactory. ``cps2`` and ``cps3`` are subsets of ``cps1``, designed to
be better matched to the experimental data than ``cps1``. Similary
``psid2`` and ``psid3`` are subsets of ``psid1``, designed to be better
matched to the experimental data than ``psid1``.
