Labour Training Evaluation Data
-------------------------------

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

This data frame contains 2675 rows and 10 columns. These data are
pertinent to an investigation of the way that earnings changed, between
1974-1975 and 1978, in the absence of training. Data for the
experimental treatment group (NSW) were combined with control data
results from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) study.
