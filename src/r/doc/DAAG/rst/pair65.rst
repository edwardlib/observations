Heated Elastic Bands
--------------------

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``pair65`` data frame has 9 rows and 2 columns. Eighteen elastic
bands were divided into nine pairs, with bands of similar stretchiness
placed in the same pair. One member of each pair was placed in hot water
(60-65 degrees C) for four minutes, while the other was left at ambient
temperature. After a wait of about ten minutes, the amounts of stretch,
under a 1.35 kg weight, were recorded.

Usage

::

    pair65

Format
~~~~~~

This data frame contains the following columns:

heated
    a numeric vector giving the stretch lengths for the heated bands

ambient
    a numeric vector giving the stretch lengths for the unheated bands
