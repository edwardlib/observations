Volume of Users of a Rail Trail
-------------------------------

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

The Pioneer Valley Planning Commission (PVPC) collected data north of
Chestnut Street in Florence, MA for ninety days from April 5, 2005 to
November 15, 2005. Data collectors set up a laser sensor, with breaks in
the laser beam recording when a rail-trail user passed the data
collection station.

Usage
~~~~~

::

    data(RailTrail)

Format
~~~~~~

A data frame with 90 observations on the following variables.

-  ``hightemp`` daily high temperature (in degrees Fahrenheit)

-  ``lowtemp`` daily low temperature (in degrees Fahrenheit)

-  ``avgtemp`` average of daily low and daily high temperature (in
   degrees Fahrenheit)

-  ``spring`` indicator of whether the season was Spring

-  ``summer`` indicator of whether the season was Summer

-  ``fall`` indicator of whether the season was Fall

-  ``cloudcover`` measure of cloud cover (in oktas)

-  ``precip`` measure of precipitation (in inches)

-  ``volume`` estimated number of trail users that day (number of breaks
   recorded)

-  ``weekday`` indicator of whether the day was a non-holiday weekday

Details
~~~~~~~

There is a potential for error when two users trigger the infrared beam
at exactly the same time since the counter would only logs one of the
crossings. The collectors left the motion detector out during the
winter, but because the counter drops data when the temperature falls
below 14 degrees Fahrenheit, there is no data for the cold winter
months.
