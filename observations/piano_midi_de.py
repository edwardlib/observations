  of 130 pieces randomly split into 92 training, 25 testing, and 13
  validation pieces [@poliner2007discriminative]. Data is loaded in
  the piano-roll representation [@boulanger2012modeling], i.e., a

  Args:
    path: str.
      Path to directory which either stores file or otherwise file will
      be downloaded and extracted there. Filename is
      `Piano-midi.de.pickle`.

  Returns:
    list of `x_train, x_test, x_valid`, where each is a list of
    sequences. Each sequence is itself a list of time steps, and each
    time step is a list of the non-zero elements in the piano-roll at
    this instant (in MIDI note numbers, between 21 and 108 inclusive).
