  growth period

  `Mass`

  Body mass (in grams)

  `LogMass`

  Log (base 10) of body mass

  `Intake`

  `DryFrass`

  Amount of frass, after drying, produced (in grams/day)

  `LogDryFrass`

  Log (base 10) of DryFrass

  `Cassim`

  CO2 assimilation (ingestion - excretion)

  `LogCassim`

  Log (base 10) of Cassim

  `Nfrass`

  Nitrogen in frass

  `LogNfrass`

  Log (base 10) of Nfrass
