  """Population of U.S. Cities

  The `bigcity` data frame has 49 rows and 2 columns.

  The `city` data frame has 10 rows and 2 columns.

  The measurements are the population (in 1000's) of 49 U.S. cities in
  1920 and 1930. The 49 cities are a random sample taken from the 196
  largest cities in 1920. The `city` data frame consists of the first 10
  observations in `bigcity`.

  This data frame contains the following columns:

  `u`
      The 1920 population.

  `x`
      The 1930 population.

  The data were obtained from

  Cochran, W.G. (1977) *Sampling Techniques*. Third edition. John Wiley

  Args:

    path: str.
      Path to directory which either stores file or otherwise file will
      be downloaded and extracted there.
      Filename is `bigcity.csv`.

  Returns:

    Tuple of np.ndarray `x_train` with 49 rows and 2 columns and
    dictionary `metadata` of column headers (feature names).
