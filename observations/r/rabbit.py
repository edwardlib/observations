  """Blood Pressure in Rabbits

  Five rabbits were studied on two occasions, after treatment with saline
  (control) and after treatment with the *5-HT\_3* antagonist MDL 72222.
  After each treatment ascending doses of phenylbiguanide were injected
  intravenously at 10 minute intervals and the responses of mean blood
  pressure measured. The goal was to test whether the cardiogenic
  chemoreflex elicited by phenylbiguanide depends on the activation of
  *5-HT\_3* receptors.

  This data frame contains 60 rows and the following variables:

  `BPchange`
      change in blood pressure relative to the start of the experiment.

  `Dose`
      dose of Phenylbiguanide in micrograms.

  `Run`
      label of run (`"C1"` to `"C5"`, then `"M1"` to `"M5"`).

  `Treatment`
      placebo or the *5-HT\_3* antagonist MDL 72222.

  `Animal`
      label of animal used (`"R1"` to `"R5"`).
