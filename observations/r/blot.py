  """Bond's Logical Operations Test â€“ BLOT

  35 items for 150 subjects from Bond's Logical Operations Test. A good
  example of Item Response Theory analysis using the Rasch model. One
  parameter (Rasch) analysis and two parameter IRT analyses produce
  somewhat different results.

  A data frame with 150 observations on 35 variables. The BLOT was
  developed as a paper and pencil test for children to measure Logical
  Thinking as discussed by Piaget and Inhelder.

  The data are taken (with kind permission from Trevor Bond) from the
  webpage http://homes.jcu.edu.au/~edtgb/book/data/Bond87.txt and read
  using read.fwf.

  Args:

    path: str.
      Path to directory which either stores file or otherwise file will
      be downloaded and extracted there.
      Filename is `blot.csv`.

  Returns:

    Tuple of np.ndarray `x_train` with 150 rows and 35 columns and
    dictionary `metadata` of column headers (feature names).
