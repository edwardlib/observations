  Some nocturnal duration measurements were coded as 2, 3 or 4 minutes,
  having originally been described as ‘short’, ‘medium’ or ‘long’.

  A data frame with 299 observations on 2 variables.

  `duration`

  numeric

  Eruption time in mins

  `waiting`

  numeric

  Waiting time for this eruption

  Args:

    path: str.
      Path to directory which either stores file or otherwise file will
      be downloaded and extracted there.
      Filename is `geyser.csv`.

  Returns:

    Tuple of np.ndarray `x_train` with 299 rows and 2 columns and
    dictionary `metadata` of column headers (feature names).
