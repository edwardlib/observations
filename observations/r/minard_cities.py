  """Data from Minard's famous graphic map of Napoleon's march on Moscow

  Charles Joseph Minard's graphic depiction of the fate of Napoleon's
  Grand Army in the Russian campaign of 1815 has been called the "greatest
  statistical graphic ever drawn" (Tufte, 1983). Friendly (2002) describes
  some background for this graphic, and presented it as Minard's Chalenge:
  to reproduce it using modern statistical or graphic software, in a way
  that showed the elegance of some computer language to both describe and
  produce this graphic.

  variables giving the number of surviving troops.
