  """Wagner's Hannover Employment Growth Data

  Wagner (1994) investigates the rate of employment growth (`y`) as
  function of percentage of people engaged in **p**\ roducation
  **a**\ ctivities (`PA`) and **h**\ igher **s**\ ervices (`HS`) and
  of the **g**\ rowth of these percentages (`GPA`, `GHS`) during three
  time periods in 21 geographical regions of the greater Hannover area.

  A data frame with *21 \* 3 = 63* observations (one per
  `Region x Period`) on the following 7 variables.

  `Region`
      a `factor` with 21 levels, denoting the corresponding region in
      Hannover (conceptually a “block factor”).

  `PA`
      numeric: percent of people involved in production activities.

  `GPA`
      **g**\ rowth of `PA`.

  `HS`
      a numeric vector

  `GHS`
      a numeric vector

  `y`
      a numeric vector

  `Period`
      a `factor` with levels `1:3`, denoting the time period, 1 =
      1979-1982, 2 = 1983-1988, 3 = 1989-1992.

  continuous and binary regressors, *Journal of Statistical Planning and
  Inference* **57**, 153–163.

  Args:

    path: str.
      Path to directory which either stores file or otherwise file will
      be downloaded and extracted there.
      Filename is `wagner_growth.csv`.

  Returns:

    Tuple of np.ndarray `x_train` with 63 rows and 7 columns and
    dictionary `metadata` of column headers (feature names).
