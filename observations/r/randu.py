  """Random Numbers from Congruential Generator RANDU

  400 triples of successive random numbers were taken from the VAX FORTRAN
  function RANDU running under VMS 1.5.

  A data frame with 400 observations on 3 variables named `x`, `y` and
  `z` which give the first, second and third random number in the
  triple.
