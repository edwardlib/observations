  """Growth Curves for Sitka Spruce Trees in 1989

  The `Sitka89` data frame has 632 rows and 4 columns. It gives repeated
  measurements on the log-size of 79 Sitka spruce trees, 54 of which were
  grown in ozone-enriched chambers and 25 were controls. The size was
  measured eight times in 1989, at roughly monthly intervals.

  This data frame contains the following columns:

  `size`
      measured size (height times diameter squared) of tree, on log scale.

  `Time`
      time of measurement in days since 1 January 1988.

  `tree`
      number of tree.

  `treat`
      either `"ozone"` for an ozone-enriched chamber or `"control"`.
