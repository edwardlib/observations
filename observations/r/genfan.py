  """Generator fans

  The data come from a field engineering study of the time to failure of
  diesel generator fans. The ultimate goal was to decide whether or not to
  replace the working fans with a higher quality fan to prevent future
  failures. Seventy generators were studied. For each one, the number of
  hours of running time from its first being put into service until fan
  failure or until the end of the study(whichever came first) was
  recorded.

  A data frame with 70 observations on the following 2 variables.

  `hours`
      hours of service

  `status`
      1=failure, 0=censored

  Args:

    path: str.
      Path to directory which either stores file or otherwise file will
      be downloaded and extracted there.
      Filename is `genfan.csv`.

  Returns:

    Tuple of np.ndarray `x_train` with 70 rows and 2 columns and
    dictionary `metadata` of column headers (feature names).
