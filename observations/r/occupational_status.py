  """Occupational Status of Fathers and their Sons

  Cross-classification of a sample of British males according to each
  subject's occupational status and his father's occupational status.

  A `table` of counts, with classifying factors `origin` (father's
  occupational status; levels `1:8`) and `destination` (son's
  occupational status; levels `1:8`).

  Goodman, L. A. (1979) Simple Models for the Analysis of Association in
  Cross-Classifications having Ordered Categories. *J. Am. Stat. Assoc.*,
  **74** (367), 537â€“552.

  The data set has been in package
  `gnm <https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=gnm>`__ and been provided by
  the package authors.

  Args:

    path: str.
      Path to directory which either stores file or otherwise file will
      be downloaded and extracted there.
      Filename is `occupational_status.csv`.

  Returns:

    Tuple of np.ndarray `x_train` with 8 rows and 8 columns and
    dictionary `metadata` of column headers (feature names).
