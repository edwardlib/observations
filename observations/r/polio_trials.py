  """Polio Field Trials Data

  The data frame `PolioTrials` gives the results of the 1954 field
  trials to test the Salk polio vaccine (named for the developer, Jonas
  Salk), conducted by the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis
  (NFIP). It is adapted from data in the article by Francis et al. (1955).
  There were actually two clinical trials, corresponding to two
  statistical designs (`Experiment`), discussed by Brownlee (1955). The
  comparison of designs and results represented a milestone in the
  development of randomized clinical trials.

  A data frame with 8 observations on the following 6 variables.

  `Experiment`
      a factor with levels `ObservedControl` `RandomizedControl`

  `Group`
      a factor with levels `Controls` `Grade2NotInoculated`
      `IncompleteVaccinations` `NotInoculated` `Placebo`
      `Vaccinated`

  `Population`
      the size of the population in each group in each experiment

  `Paralytic`
      the number of cases of paralytic polio observed in that group

  `NonParalytic`
      the number of cases of paralytic polio observed in that group

  `FalseReports`
      the number of cases initially reported as polio, but later
      determined not to be polio in that group
