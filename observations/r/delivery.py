  """Delivery Time Data

  Delivery Time Data, from Montgomery and Peck (1982). The aim is to
  explain the time required to service a vending machine (Y) by means of
  the number of products stocked (X1) and the distance walked by the route
  driver (X2).

  A data frame with 25 observations on the following 3 variables.

  `n.prod`
      Number of Products

  `distance`
      Distance

  `delTime`
      Delivery time

  Montgomery and Peck (1982, p.116)

  Args:

    path: str.
      Path to directory which either stores file or otherwise file will
      be downloaded and extracted there.
      Filename is `delivery.csv`.

  Returns:

    Tuple of np.ndarray `x_train` with 25 rows and 3 columns and
    dictionary `metadata` of column headers (feature names).
