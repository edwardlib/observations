  The data come to us from Hosmer and Lemeshow (2000). Called the low
  birth weight (lbw) data, the response is a binary variable, low, which
  indicates whether the birth weight of a baby is under 2500g (low=1), or
  over (low=0).

  A data frame with 189 observations on the following 10 variables.

  `low`
      1=low birthweight baby; 0=norml weight

  `smoke`
      1=history of mother smoking; 0=mother nonsmoker

  `race`
      categorical 1-3: 1=white; 2-=black; 3=other

  `age`
      age of mother: 14-45

  `lwt`
      weight (lbs) at last menstrual period: 80-250 lbs

  `ptl`
      number of false of premature labors: 0-3

  `ht`
      1=history of hypertension; 0 =no hypertension

  `ui`
      1=uterine irritability; 0 no irritability

  `ftv`
      number of physician visits in 1st trimester: 0-6

  `bwt`
      birth weight in grams: 709 - 4990 gr
