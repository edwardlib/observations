  """Davis's Data on Drive for Thinness

  The `DavisThin` data frame has 191 rows and 7 columns. This is part of
  a larger dataset for a study of eating disorders. The seven variables in
  the data frame comprise a "drive for thinness" scale, to be formed by
  summing the items.

  This data frame contains the following columns:

  DT1
      a numeric vector

  DT2
      a numeric vector

  DT3
      a numeric vector

  DT4
      a numeric vector

  DT5
