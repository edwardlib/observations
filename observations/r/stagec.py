  """Stage C Prostate Cancer

  A set of 146 patients with stage C prostate cancer, from a study
  exploring the prognostic value of flow cytometry.

  A data frame with 146 observations on the following 8 variables.

  `pgtime`
      Time to progression or last follow-up (years)

  `pgstat`
      1 = progression observed, 0 = censored

  `age`
      age in years

  `eet`
      early endocrine therapy, 1 = no, 2 = yes

  `g2`
      percent of cells in G2 phase, as found by flow cytometry

  `grade`
      grade of the tumor, Farrow system

  `gleason`
      grade of the tumor, Gleason system

  `ploidy`
      the ploidy status of the tumor, from flow cytometry. Values are
      diploid, tetraploid, and aneuploid

  Args:

    path: str.
      Path to directory which either stores file or otherwise file will
      be downloaded and extracted there.
      Filename is `stagec.csv`.

  Returns:

    Tuple of np.ndarray `x_train` with 146 rows and 8 columns and
    dictionary `metadata` of column headers (feature names).
