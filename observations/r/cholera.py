  """William Farr's Data on Cholera in London, 1849

  In 1852, William Farr, published a report of the Registrar-General on
  mortality due to cholera in England in the years 1848-1849, during which
  there was a large epidemic throughout the country. Farr initially
  believed that cholera arose from bad air ("miasma") associated with low
  elevation above the River Thames. John Snow (1855) later showed that the
  disease was principally spread by contaminated water.

  This data set comes from a paper by Brigham et al. (2003) that analyses
  some tables from Farr's report to examine the prevalence of death from
  cholera in the districts of London in relation to the available
  predictors from Farr's table.

  A data frame with 38 observations on the following 15 variables.

  `district`
      name of the district in London, a character vector

  `cholera_drate`
      deaths from cholera in 1849 per 10,000 inhabitants, a numeric vector

  `cholera_deaths`
      number of deaths registered from cohlera in 1849, a numeric vector

  `popn`
      population, in the middle of 1849, a numeric vector

  `elevation`
      elevation, in feet above the high water mark, a numeric vector

  `region`
      a grouping of the London districts, a factor with levels `West`
      `North` `Central` `South` `Kent`

  `water`
      water supply region, a factor with levels `Battersea`
      `New River` `Kew`; see Details

  `annual_deaths`
      annual deaths from all causes, 1838-1844, a numeric vector

  `pop_dens`
      population density (persons per acre), a numeric vector

  `persons_house`
      persons per inhabited house, a numeric vector

  `house_valpp`
      average annual value of house, per person (pounds), a numeric vector

  `poor_rate`
      poor rate precept per pound of howse value, a numeric vector

  `area`
      district area, a numeric vector

  `houses`
      number of houses, a numeric vector

  `house_val`
      total house values, a numeric vector
