  """Delay in AIDS Reporting in England and Wales

  The `aids` data frame has 570 rows and 6 columns.

  Although all cases of AIDS in England and Wales must be reported to the
  Communicable Disease Surveillance Centre, there is often a considerable
  delay between the time of diagnosis and the time that it is reported. In
  estimating the prevalence of AIDS, account must be taken of the unknown
  number of cases which have been diagnosed but not reported. The data set
  here records the reported cases of AIDS diagnosed from July 1983 and
  until the end of 1992. The data are cross-classified by the date of
  diagnosis and the time delay in the reporting of the cases.

  This data frame contains the following columns:

  `year`
      The year of the diagnosis.

  `quarter`
      The quarter of the year in which diagnosis was made.

  `delay`
      The time delay (in months) between diagnosis and reporting. 0 means
      that the case was reported within one month. Longer delays are
      grouped in 3 month intervals and the value of `delay` is the
      midpoint of the interval (therefore a value of `2` indicates that
      reporting was delayed for between 1 and 3 months).

  `dud`
      An indicator of censoring. These are categories for which full
      information is not yet available and the number recorded is a lower
      bound only.

  `time`
      The time interval of the diagnosis. That is the number of quarters
      from July 1983 until the end of the quarter in which these cases
      were diagnosed.

  `y`
      The number of AIDS cases reported.

  The data were obtained from

  De Angelis, D. and Gilks, W.R. (1994) Estimating acquired immune
  deficiency syndrome accounting for reporting delay. *Journal of the
  Royal Statistical Society, A*, **157**, 31â€“40.
