  Code (1-6) for sample of olive oil

  `Group`

  Code for group: `1` or `2`

  `Day`

  Time (in days) when sample was measured: `0`, `281`, or `365`

  `Fenthion`

  Amount of fenthion (pesticide)

  `FenthionSulphoxide`

  Amount of fenthion sulfide

  `FenthionSulphone`

  Amount of fenthion sulphone

  `Time`

  Code (0, 3, or 4) for the number of days

  Data provided by Rosemary Roberts and discussed in "Persistence of
  fenthion residues in olive oil" by Chaido Lentza-Rizos, Elizabeth J.

  Args:

    path: str.
      Path to directory which either stores file or otherwise file will
      be downloaded and extracted there.
      Filename is `olives.csv`.

  Returns:

    Tuple of np.ndarray `x_train` with 18 rows and 7 columns and
    dictionary `metadata` of column headers (feature names).
