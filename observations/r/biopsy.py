  """Biopsy Data on Breast Cancer Patients

  This breast cancer database was obtained from the University of
  Wisconsin Hospitals, Madison from Dr. William H. Wolberg. He assessed
  biopsies of breast tumours for 699 patients up to 15 July 1992; each of
  nine attributes has been scored on a scale of 1 to 10, and the outcome
  is also known. There are 699 rows and 11 columns.

  This data frame contains the following columns:

  `ID`
      sample code number (not unique).

  `V1`
      clump thickness.

  `V2`
      uniformity of cell size.

  `V3`
      uniformity of cell shape.

  `V4`
      marginal adhesion.

  `V5`
      single epithelial cell size.

  `V6`
      bare nuclei (16 values are missing).

  `V7`
      bland chromatin.

  `V8`
      normal nucleoli.

  `V9`
      mitoses.

  `class`
      `"benign"` or `"malignant"`.
