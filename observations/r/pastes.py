  """Paste strength by batch and cask

  Strength of a chemical paste product; its quality depending on the
  delivery batch, and the cask within the delivery.

  A data frame with 60 observations on the following 4 variables.

  `strength`
      paste strength.

  `batch`
      delivery batch from which the sample was sample. A factor with 10
      levels: ‘A’ to ‘J’.

  `cask`
      cask within the delivery batch from which the sample was chosen. A
      factor with 3 levels: ‘a’ to ‘c’.

  `sample`
      the sample of paste whose strength was assayed, two assays per
      sample. A factor with 30 levels: ‘A:a’ to ‘J:c’.
