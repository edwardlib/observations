  """Log-size of 79 Sitka spruce trees

  The `spruce` data frame has 1027 rows and 6 columns. The data consists
  of measurements on 79 sitka spruce trees over two growing seasons. The
  trees were grown in four controlled environment chambers, of which the
  first two, containing 27 trees each, were treated with introduced ozone
  at 70 ppb whilst the remaining two, containing 12 and 13 trees, were
  controls.

  This data frame contains the following columns:

  chamber
      a numeric vector of chamber numbers

  ozone
      a factor with levels `enriched` and `normal`

  id
      a numeric vector of tree id

  time
      a numeric vector of the time when the measurements were taken,
      measured in days since Jan. 1, 1988

  wave
      a numeric vector of the measurement number

  logsize
      a numeric vector of the log-size
