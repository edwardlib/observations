  """Swiss Fertility and Socioeconomic Indicators (1888) Data

  Standardized fertility measure and socio-economic indicators for each of
  47 French-speaking provinces of Switzerland at about 1888.

  A data frame with 47 observations on 6 variables, *each* of which is in
  percent, i.e., in *[0, 100]*.

  +------+-----------------+-------------------------------------------------+
  | [,1] | Fertility       | *Ig*, ‘common standardized fertility measure’   |
  +------+-----------------+-------------------------------------------------+
  | [,2] | Agriculture     | % of males involved in agriculture as occupation|
  +------+-----------------+-------------------------------------------------+
  | [,3] | Examination     | % draftees receiving highest mark on army       |
  |      |                 | examination                                     |

  All variables but ‘Fertility’ give proportions of the population.

  (paraphrasing Mosteller and Tukey):

  Switzerland, in 1888, was entering a period known as the *demographic
  transition*; i.e., its fertility was beginning to fall from the high
  level typical of underdeveloped countries.

  The data collected are for 47 French-speaking “provinces” at about 1888.

  Here, all variables are scaled to *[0, 100]*, where in the original, all
  but `"Catholic"` were scaled to *[0, 1]*.
