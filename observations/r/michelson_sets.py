  """Michelson's Determinations of the Velocity of Light

  The data frame `Michelson` gives Albert Michelson's measurements of
  the velocity of light in air, made from June 5 to July 2, 1879, reported
  in Michelson (1882). The given values + 299,000 are Michelson's
  measurements in km/sec. The number of cases is 100 and the "true" value
  on this scale is 734.5.

  Stigler (1977) used these data to illustrate properties of robust
  estimators with real, historical data. For this purpose, he divided the
  100 measurements into 5 sets of 20 each. These are contained in
  `MichelsonSets`.

  `Michelson`: A data frame with 100 observations on the following
  variable, given in time order of data collection

  `velocity`
      a numeric vector

  `MichelsonSets`: A 20 x 5 matrix, with format int [1:20, 1:5] 850 850
  1000 810 960 800 830 830 880 720 ... - attr(\*, "dimnames")=List of 2
  ..$ : NULL ..$ : chr [1:5] "ds12" "ds13" "ds14" "ds15" ...
