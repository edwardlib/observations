  """Darwin's Heights of Cross- and Self-fertilized Zea May Pairs

  Darwin (1876) studied the growth of pairs of zea may (aka corn)
  seedlings, one produced by cross-fertilization and the other produced by
  self-fertilization, but otherwise grown under identical conditions. His
  goal was to demonstrate the greater vigour of the cross-fertilized
  plants. The data recorded are the final height (inches, to the nearest
  1/8th) of the plants in each pair.

  In the *Design of Experiments*, Fisher (1935) used these data to
  illustrate a paired t-test (well, a one-sample test on the mean
  difference, `cross - self`). Later in the book (section 21), he used
  this data to illustrate an early example of a non-parametric permutation
  test, treating each paired difference as having (randomly) either a
  positive or negative sign.

  A data frame with 15 observations on the following 4 variables.

  `pair`
      pair number, a numeric vector

  `pot`
      pot, a factor with levels `1` `2` `3` `4`

  `cross`
      height of cross fertilized plant, a numeric vector

  `self`
      height of self fertilized plant, a numeric vector

  `diff`
      `cross - self` for each pair
