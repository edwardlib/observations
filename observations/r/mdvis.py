  Data from a subset of the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP). The subset
  was created by Rabe-Hesketh and Skrondal (2005). Only working women are
  included in these data. Beginning in 1997, German health reform in part
  entailed a 200 co-payment as well as limits in provider reimbursement.
  Patients were surveyed for the one year panel (1996) prior to and the
  one year panel (1998) after reform to assess whether the number of
  physician visits by patients declined - which was the goal of reform
  legislation. The response, or variable to be explained by the model, is
  numvisit, which indicates the number of patient visits to a physician's
  office during a three month period.

  A data frame with 2,227 observations on the following 13 variables.

  `numvisit`

  `badh`
      1=bad health; 0 = not bad health

  `age`
      Age(yrs 20-60)

  `educ`
      education(1:7-10;2=10.5-12;3=HSgrad+)

  `educ1`
      educ1= 7-10 years

  `educ2`
      educ2= 10.5-12 years

  `educ3`
      educ3= post secondary or high school

  `agegrp`
      age: 1=20-39; 2=40-49; 3=50-60

  `age1`
      age 20-39

  `age2`
