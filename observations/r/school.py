  """School-level data

  The original data source is the Education Longitudinal Study of 2002. To
  deal with the issue on individually identifiable information, we
  generated hypothetical student-level data using a multiple imputation
  method. The Education Longitudinal Study of 2002 used a two-stage sample
  selection process. First, a national sample of schools was selected
  using stratified probability proportional to size (PPS), and school
  contacting resulted in 1,221 eligible public, Catholic, and other
  private schools from a population of approximately 27,000 schools
  containing 10th grade students. Of the eligible schools, 752
  participated in the study. In the second stage of sample selection, a
  sample of approximately 26 sophomores, from within each of the
  participating public and private schools was selected. Each school was
  asked to provide a list of 10th grade students, and quality assurance
  (QA) checks were performed on each list that was received.

  A data matrix with 568 rows and 5 columns, containing no missing values.
  The data are provided only for illustrative purposes and not for
  inference about education effectiveness, for which the original data
  source should be consulted.
