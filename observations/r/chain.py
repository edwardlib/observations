  """Subset of variables from the CHAIN project

  The CHAIN project was a longitudinal cohort study of people living with
  HIV in New York City, which was recruited in 1994 from a large number of
  medical care and social service agencies serving HIV in New York City.
  This subset of data pertain to the sixth round of interviews.

  A `data.frame` with 532 observations on the following 8 variables.

  `log_virus`
      log of self reported viral load level, where zero represents an
      undetectable level.

  `age`
      age at time of the interview

  `income`
      annual family income in 10 intervals

  `healthy`
      a continuous scale of physical health with a theoretical range
      between 0 and 100 where better health is associated with higher
      scale values

  `mental`
      a binary measure of poor mental health ( 1=Yes, 0=No )

  `damage`
      ordered interval for the CD4 count, which is an indicator of how
      much damage HIV has caused to the immune system

  `treatment`
      a three-level ordered variable: 0=Not currently taking HAART (Highly
      Active AntiretRoviral Therapy) 1=taking HAART but nonadherent,
      2=taking HAART and adherent
