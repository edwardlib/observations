  """Synthetic Classification Problem

  The `synth.tr` data frame has 250 rows and 3 columns. The `synth.te`
  data frame has 100 rows and 3 columns. It is intended that `synth.tr`
  be used from training and `synth.te` for testing.

  These data frames contains the following columns:

  `xs`
      x-coordinate

  `ys`
      y-coordinate

  `yc`
      class, coded as 0 or 1.

  classification (with discussion). *Journal of the Royal Statistical
  Society series B* **56**, 409â€“456.

  Args:

    path: str.
      Path to directory which either stores file or otherwise file will
      be downloaded and extracted there.
      Filename is `synth_tr.csv`.

  Returns:

    Tuple of np.ndarray `x_train` with 250 rows and 3 columns and
    dictionary `metadata` of column headers (feature names).
