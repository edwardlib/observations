  """Scottish Hill Races Data - 2000

  The record times in 2000 for 77 Scottish long distance races. We believe
  the data are, for the most part, trustworthy. However, the `dist`
  variable for Caerketton (record 58) seems to have been variously
  recorded as 1.5 mi and 2.5 mi.

  This data frame contains the following columns:

  dist
      distance, in miles (on the map)

  climb
      total height gained during the route, in feet

  time
      record time in hours

  timef
      record time in hours for females

  type
      a factor, with levels indicating type of race, i.e. hill, marathon,
      relay, uphill or other

  Args:

    path: str.
      Path to directory which either stores file or otherwise file will
      be downloaded and extracted there.
      Filename is `races2000.csv`.

  Returns:

    Tuple of np.ndarray `x_train` with 77 rows and 5 columns and
    dictionary `metadata` of column headers (feature names).
