  """Plant Species Traits Data

  This dataset constitutes a description of 136 plant species according to
  biological attributes (morphological or reproductive)

  A data frame with 136 observations on the following 31 variables.

  `pdias`
      Diaspore mass (mg)

  `longindex`
      Seed bank longevity

  `durflow`
      Flowering duration

  `height`
      Plant height, an ordered factor with levels `1` < `2` < ... <
      `8`.

  `begflow`
      Time of first flowering, an ordered factor with levels `1` < `2`
      < `3` < `4` < `5` < `6` < `7` < `8` < `9`

  `mycor`
      Mycorrhizas, an ordered factor with levels `0`\ never < `1`
      sometimes< `2`\ always

  `vegaer`
      aerial vegetative propagation, an ordered factor with levels
      `0`\ never < `1` present but limited< `2`\ important.

  `vegsout`
      underground vegetative propagation, an ordered factor with 3 levels
      identical to `vegaer` above.

  `autopoll`
      selfing pollination, an ordered factor with levels `0`\ never <
      `1`\ rare < `2` often< the rule\ `3`

  `insects`
      insect pollination, an ordered factor with 5 levels `0` < ... <
      `4`.

  `wind`
      wind pollination, an ordered factor with 5 levels `0` < ... <
      `4`.

  `lign`
      a binary factor with levels `0:1`, indicating if plant is woody.

  `piq`
      a binary factor indicating if plant is thorny.

  `ros`
      a binary factor indicating if plant is rosette.

  `semiros`
      semi-rosette plant, a binary factor (`0`: no; `1`: yes).

  `leafy`
      leafy plant, a binary factor.

  `suman`

      seasonal aestival leaves, a binary factor.

  `seashiv`
      seasonal hibernal leaves, a binary factor.

  `seasver`
      seasonal vernal leaves, a binary factor.

  `everalw`
      leaves always evergreen, a binary factor.

  `everparti`
      leaves partially evergreen, a binary factor.

  `elaio`
      fruits with an elaiosome (dispersed by ants), a binary factor.

  `endozoo`
      endozoochorous fruits, a binary factor.

  `epizoo`
      epizoochorous fruits, a binary factor.

  `aquat`
      aquatic dispersal fruits, a binary factor.

  `windgl`
      wind dispersed fruits, a binary factor.

  `unsp`
      unspecialized mechanism of seed dispersal, a binary factor.
