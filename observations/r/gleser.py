  """Example data from Gleser, Cronbach and Rajaratnam (1965) to show basic pri
  nciples of generalizability theory.

  Gleser, Cronbach and Rajaratnam (1965) discuss the estimation of
  variance components and their ratios as part of their introduction to
  generalizability theory. This is a adaptation of their "illustrative
  data for a completely matched G study" (Table 3). 12 patients are rated
  on 6 symptoms by two judges. Components of variance are derived from the
  ANOVA.

  A data frame with 12 observations on the following 12 variables. J item
  by judge:

  `J11`
      a numeric vector

  `J12`
      a numeric vector

  `J21`
      a numeric vector

  `J22`
      a numeric vector

  `J31`
      a numeric vector

  `J32`
      a numeric vector

  `J41`
      a numeric vector

  `J42`
      a numeric vector

  `J51`
      a numeric vector

  `J52`
      a numeric vector

  `J61`
      a numeric vector

  `J62`
      a numeric vector
