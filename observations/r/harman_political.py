  """Eight political variables used by Harman (1967) as example 8.17

  Another one of the many Harman (1967) data sets. This contains 8
  political variables taken over 147 election areas. The principal factor
  method with SMCs as communalities match those of table 8.18. The data
  are used by Dziubian and Shirkey as an example of the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin
  test of factor adequacy.

  The format is: num [1:8, 1:8] 1 0.84 0.62 -0.53 0.03 0.57 -0.33 -0.63
  0.84 1 ... - attr(\*, "dimnames")=List of 2 ..$ : chr [1:8] "Lewis"
  "Roosevelt" "Party Voting" "Median Rental" ... ..$ : chr [1:8] "Lewis"
  "Roosevelt" "Party Voting" "Median Rental" ...
