  """Tuna Sighting Data

  The `tuna` data frame has 64 rows and 1 columns.

  The data come from an aerial line transect survey of Southern Bluefin
  Tuna in the Great Australian Bight. An aircraft with two spotters on
  board flies randomly allocated line transects. Each school of tuna
  sighted is counted and its perpendicular distance from the transect
  measured. The survey was conducted in summer when tuna tend to stay on
  the surface.

  This data frame contains the following column:

  `y`
      The perpendicular distance, in miles, from the transect for 64
      independent sightings of tuna schools.

  The data were obtained from

  Chen, S.X. (1996) Empirical likelihood confidence intervals for
  nonparametric density estimation. *Biometrika*, **83**, 329â€“341.

  Args:

    path: str.
      Path to directory which either stores file or otherwise file will
      be downloaded and extracted there.
      Filename is `tuna.csv`.

  Returns:

    Tuple of np.ndarray `x_train` with 64 rows and 1 columns and
    dictionary `metadata` of column headers (feature names).
