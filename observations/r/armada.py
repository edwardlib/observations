  """La Felicisima Armada

  The Spanish Armada (Spanish: *Grande y Felicisima Armada*, literally
  "Great and Most Fortunate Navy") was a Spanish fleet of 130 ships that
  sailed from La Coruna in August 1588. During its preparation, several
  accounts of its formidable strength were circulated to reassure allied
  powers of Spain or to intimidate its enemies. One such account was given
  by Paz Salas et Alvarez (1588). The intent was bring the forces of Spain
  to invade England, overthrow Queen Elizabeth I, and re-establish Spanish
  control of the Netherlands. However the Armada was not as fortunate as
  hoped: it was all destroyed in one week's fighting.

  de Falguerolles (2008) reports the table given here as `Armada` as an
  early example of data to which multivariate methods might be applied.

  A data frame with 10 observations on the following 11 variables.

  `Armada`
      designation of the fleet, a factor with levels `Andalucia`
      `Castilla` `Galeras` `Guipuscua` `Napoles` `Pataches`
      `Portugal` `Uantiscas` `Vizca` `Vrcas`

  `ships`
      number of ships, a numeric vector

  `tons`
      total tons, a numeric vector

  `soldiers`
      number of soldiers, a numeric vector

  `sailors`
      number of sailors, a numeric vector

  `men`
      total of soldiers plus sailors, a numeric vector

  `artillery`
      a numeric vector

  `balls`
      a numeric vector

  `gunpowder`
      a numeric vector

  `lead`
      a numeric vector

  `rope`
      a numeric vector
