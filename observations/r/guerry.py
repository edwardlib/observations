  """Data from A.-M. Guerry, "Essay on the Moral Statistics of France"

  Andre-Michel Guerry (1833) was the first to systematically collect and
  analyze social data on such things as crime, literacy and suicide with
  the view to determining social laws and the relations among these
  variables.

  The Guerry data frame comprises a collection of 'moral variables' on the
  86 departments of France around 1830. A few additional variables have
  been added from other sources.
