  """Halley's Life Table

  In 1693 the famous English astronomer Edmond Halley studied the birth
  and death records of the city of Breslau, which had been transmitted to
  the Royal Society by Caspar Neumann. He produced a life table showing
  the number of people surviving to any age from a cohort born the same
  year. He also used his table to compute the price of life annuities.

  A data frame with 84 observations on the following 4 variables.

  `age`
      a numeric vector

  `deaths`
      number of deaths, *D\_k*, among people of age k, a numeric vector

  `number`
      size of the population, *P\_k* surviving until this age, a numeric
      vector

  `ratio`
      the ratio *P\_{k+1}/P\_k*, the conditional probability of surviving
      until age k + 1 given that one had already reached age k, a numeric
      vector
