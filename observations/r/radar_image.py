  Provided are coordinates and values corresponding to three frequency
  bands for each of 1573 pixels.

  A data frame with 1573 observations on the following 5 variables.

  `X.coord`
      a numeric vector

  `Y.coord`
      a numeric vector

  `Band.1`
      a numeric vector

  `Band.2`
      a numeric vector

  `Band.3`
      a numeric vector
