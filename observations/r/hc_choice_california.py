  A dataframe containing :

  depvar
      heating system, one of gcc (gas central heat with cooling), ecc
      (electric central resistence heat with cooling), erc (electric room
      resistence heat with cooling), hpc (electric heat pump which
      provides cooling also), gc (gas central heat without cooling, ec
      (electric central resistence heat without cooling), er (electric
      room resistence heat without cooling)

  ich.z
      installation cost of the heating portion of the system

  icca
      installation cost for cooling

  och.z
      operating cost for the heating portion of the system

  occa
      operating cost for cooling

  income
      annual income of the household

  Args:
