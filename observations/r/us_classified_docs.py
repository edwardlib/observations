  """Official Secrecy of the United States Government

  Data on classification activity of the United States government.

  Fitzpatrick (2013) notes that the dramatic jump in derivative
  classification activity (`DerivClassActivity`) that occurred in 2009
  coincided with "New guidance issued to include electronic environment".
  Apart from the jump in 2009, the `DerivClassActivity` tended to
  increase by roughly 12 percent per year (with a standard deviation of
  the increase in the natural logarithm of `DerivClassActivity` of
  0.18).

  A dataframe containing :

  year
      the calendar year

  OCAuthority
      Number of people in the government designated as Original
      Classification Authorities for the indicated `year`.

  OCActivity
      Original classification activity for the indicated year: These are
      the number of documents created with an original classification,
      i.e., so designated by an official Original Classification
      Authority.

  TenYearDeclass
      Percent of `OCActivity` covered by the 10 year declassification
      rules.

  DerivClassActivity
      Derivative classification activity for the indicated year: These are
      the number of documents created that claim another document as the
      authority for classification.
