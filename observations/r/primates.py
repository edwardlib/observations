  """Primate Body and Brain Weights

  A subset of `Animals` data frame from the MASS library. It contains
  the average body and brain measurements of five primates.

  This data frame contains the following columns:

  Bodywt
      a numeric vector consisting of the body weights (in kg) of five
      different primates

  Brainwt
      a numeric vector consisting of the corresponding brain weights (in
      g)

  Detection. Wiley, p. 57.

  Args:

    path: str.
      Path to directory which either stores file or otherwise file will
      be downloaded and extracted there.
      Filename is `primates.csv`.

  Returns:

    Tuple of np.ndarray `x_train` with 5 rows and 2 columns and
    dictionary `metadata` of column headers (feature names).
