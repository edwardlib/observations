  """Daily Log Returns on BMW Share Price

  These data are the daily log returns on BMW share price from Tuesday 2nd
  January 1973 until Tuesday 23rd July 1996. The data are contained in a

  `times` attribute, which is an object of class `"POSIXct"` (see
  `DateTimeClasses`). Note that these data form an irregular time series
  because no trading takes place at the weekend.

  A numeric vector containing 6146 observations, with a `times`

  Args:

    path: str.
      Path to directory which either stores file or otherwise file will
      be downloaded and extracted there.
