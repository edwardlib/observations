  """Six Mental Tests

  These data are from the SAS manual and consist of six mental tests for
  32 students, with some missing data. The three `x` variables are
  intended to load on a verbal factor, and the three `y` variables on a
  math factor. The data can be used to illustrate the estimation of a
  confirmatory factor analysis model by multinormal full-information
  maximum-likelihood in the presence of missing data.

  A data frame with 32 observations on the following 6 variables.

  `x1`
      score on verbal test 1.

  `x2`
      score on verbal test 2.

  `x3`
      score on verbal test 3.

  `y1`
      score on math test 1.

  `y2`
      score on math test 2.

  `y3`
      score on math test 3.


  Args:

    path: str.
      Path to directory which either stores file or otherwise file will
      be downloaded and extracted there.
      Filename is `mental_tests.csv`.

  Returns:

    Tuple of np.ndarray `x_train` with 32 rows and 6 columns and
    dictionary `metadata` of column headers (feature names).
