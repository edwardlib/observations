  """Frosted Flakes data

  The `frosted flakes` data frame has 101 rows and 2 columns giving the
  sugar concentration (in percent) for 25 g samples of a cereal as
  measured by 2 methods â€“ high performance liquid chromatography (a slow
  accurate lab method) and a quick method using the infra-analyzer 400.

  This data frame contains the following columns:

  Lab
      careful laboratory analysis measurements using high performance
      liquid chromatography

  IA400
      measurements based on the infra-analyzer 400


  Args:

    path: str.
      Path to directory which either stores file or otherwise file will
      be downloaded and extracted there.
      Filename is `frostedflakes.csv`.

  Returns:

    Tuple of np.ndarray `x_train` with 100 rows and 2 columns and
    dictionary `metadata` of column headers (feature names).
