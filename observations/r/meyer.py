  """A pedigree data on 282 animals deriving from two generations

  A data frame attributed to Meyer (1989).

  “The pedigrees for each of these 282 animals derive from an additional
  24 base population (Generation 0) animals that do not have records of
  their own but, nevertheless, are of interest with respect to the
  inference on their own additive genetic values. Furthermore, it is
  presumed that these original 24 base animals are not related to each
  other. Therefore, the row dimension of u is 306 (282+24).” (Templeman
  \\& Rosa 2004)
