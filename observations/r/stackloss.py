  """Brownlee's Stack Loss Plant Data

  Operational data of a plant for the oxidation of ammonia to nitric acid.

  `stackloss` is a data frame with 21 observations on 4 variables.

  [,1]

  `Air Flow`

  Flow of cooling air

  [,2]

  `Water Temp`

  Cooling Water Inlet Temperature

  [,3]

  `Acid Conc.`

  Concentration of acid [per 1000, minus 500]

  [,4]

  `stack.loss`

  Stack loss

  For compatibility with S-PLUS, the data sets `stack.x`, a matrix with
  the first three (independent) variables of the data frame, and
  `stack.loss`, the numeric vector giving the fourth (dependent)
  variable, are provided as well.
