  """Simulated Manufacturing Process Data

  The `capability` data frame has 75 rows and 1 columns.

  The data are simulated successive observations from a process in
  equilibrium. The process is assumed to have specification limits (5.49,
  5.79).

  This data frame contains the following column:

  `y`
      The simulated measurements.

  The data were obtained from

  Bissell, A.F. (1990) How reliable is your capability index? *Applied
  Statistics*, **39**, 331â€“340.

  Args:

    path: str.
      Path to directory which either stores file or otherwise file will
      be downloaded and extracted there.
      Filename is `capability.csv`.

  Returns:

    Tuple of np.ndarray `x_train` with 75 rows and 1 columns and
    dictionary `metadata` of column headers (feature names).
