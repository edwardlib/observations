  """Soldering of Components on Printed-Circuit Boards

  The `solder` data frame has 720 rows and 6 columns, representing a
  balanced subset of a designed experiment varying 5 factors on the
  soldering of components on printed-circuit boards.

  This data frame contains the following columns:

  `Opening`
      a factor with levels L, M and S indicating the amount of clearance
      around the mounting pad.

  `Solder`
      a factor with levels Thick and Thin giving the thickness of the
      solder used.

  `Mask`
      a factor with levels A1.5, A3, B3 and B6 indicating the type and
      thickness of mask used.

  `PadType`
      a factor with levels D4, D6, D7, L4, L6, L7, L8, L9, W4 and W9
      giving the size and geometry of the mounting pad.

  `Panel`
      `1:3` indicating the panel on a board being tested.

  `skips`
      a numeric vector giving the number of visible solder skips.
