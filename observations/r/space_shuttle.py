  """Space Shuttle O-ring Failures

  Data from Dalal et al. (1989) about O-ring failures in the NASA space
  shuttle program. The damage index comes from a discussion of the data by
  Tufte (1997).

  A data frame with 24 observations and 6 variables.

  FlightNumber
      Number of space shuttle flight.

  Temperature
      temperature during start (in degrees F).

  Pressure
      pressure.

  Fail
      did any O-ring failures occur? (no, yes).

  nFailures
      how many (of six) 0-rings failed?.

  Damage
      damage index.
