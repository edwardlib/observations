  """Heart Catherization Data

  This data set was analyzed by Weisberg (1980) and Chambers et al.
  (1983). A catheter is passed into a major vein or artery at the femoral
  region and moved into the heart. The proper length of the introduced
  catheter has to be guessed by the physician. The aim of the data set is
  to describe the relation between the catheter length and the patient's
  height (X1) and weight (X2).

  This data sets is used to demonstrate the effects caused by
  collinearity. The correlation between height and weight is so high that
  either variable almost completely determines the other.

  A data frame with 12 observations on the following 3 variables.

  `height`
      Patient's height in inches

  `weight`
      Patient's weights in pounds

  `clength`
      Y: Catheter Length (in centimeters)
