  """Pole Positions of New Caledonian Laterites

  The `polar` data frame has 50 rows and 2 columns.

  The data are the pole positions from a paleomagnetic study of New
  Caledonian laterites.

  This data frame contains the following columns:

  `lat`
      The latitude (in degrees) of the pole position. Note that all
      latitudes are negative as the axis is taken to be in the lower
      hemisphere.

  `long`
      The longitude (in degrees) of the pole position.

  The data were obtained from

  Fisher, N.I., Lewis, T. and Embleton, B.J.J. (1987) *Statistical
  Analysis of Spherical Data*. Cambridge University Press.

  Args:

    path: str.
      Path to directory which either stores file or otherwise file will
      be downloaded and extracted there.
      Filename is `polar.csv`.

  Returns:

    Tuple of np.ndarray `x_train` with 50 rows and 2 columns and
    dictionary `metadata` of column headers (feature names).
