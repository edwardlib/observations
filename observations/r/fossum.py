  """Female Possum Measurements

  The `fossum` data frame consists of nine morphometric measurements on
  each of 43 female mountain brushtail possums, trapped at seven sites
  from Southern Victoria to central Queensland. This is a subset of the
  `possum` data frame.

  This data frame contains the following columns:

  case
      observation number

  site
      one of seven locations where possums were trapped

  Pop
      a factor which classifies the sites as `Vic` Victoria, `other`
      New South Wales or Queensland

  sex
      a factor with levels `f` female, `m` male

  age
      age

  hdlngth
      head length

  skullw
      skull width

  totlngth
      total length

  taill
      tail length

  footlgth
      foot length

  earconch
      ear conch length

  eye
      distance from medial canthus to lateral canthus of right eye

  chest
      chest girth (in cm)

  belly
      belly girth (in cm)
