  """The Nine Largest Lakes in Manitoba

  The `Manitoba.lakes` data frame has 9 rows and 2 columns. The areas
  and elevations of the nine largest lakes in Manitoba, Canada. The
  geography of Manitoba (a relatively flat province) can be divided
  crudely into three main areas: a very flat prairie in the south which is
  at a relatively high elevation, a middle region consisting of mainly of
  forest and Precambrian rock, and a northern region which drains more
  rapidly into Hudson Bay. All water in Manitoba, which does not
  evaporate, eventually drains into Hudson Bay.

  This data frame contains the following columns:

  elevation
      a numeric vector consisting of the elevations of the lakes (in
      meters)

  area
      a numeric vector consisting of the areas of the lakes (in square
      kilometers)

  The CANSIM data base at Statistics Canada.

  Args:

    path: str.
      Path to directory which either stores file or otherwise file will
      be downloaded and extracted there.
      Filename is `manitoba_lakes.csv`.

  Returns:

    Tuple of np.ndarray `x_train` with 9 rows and 2 columns and
    dictionary `metadata` of column headers (feature names).
