  """Mendel's F2 trifactorial data

  The `mendel3` data frame has 27 rows and 4 columns. Data are from
  Mendel (1886), and are reproduced in Fisher (1936) and Weir (1996).

  ABC:
  Seed Shape      (A: round or wrinkled)
  Cotyledon Color (B: albumen yellow or green)
  Seed Coat Color (C: grey-brown or white)


  This data frame contains the following columns:

  seedshape
      Factor with levels: `AA`, `Aa` and `aa`

  cotylcolor
      Factor with levels: `BB`, `Bb` and `bb`

  coatcolor
      Factor with levels: `CC`, `Cc` and `cc`

  Observed
      a numeric vector that holds the frequencies.

  Data are from Mendel (1886), and are reproduced in Fisher (1936) and
  Weir (1996).

  Args:

    path: str.
      Path to directory which either stores file or otherwise file will
      be downloaded and extracted there.
      Filename is `mendel_abc.csv`.

  Returns:

    Tuple of np.ndarray `x_train` with 27 rows and 4 columns and
    dictionary `metadata` of column headers (feature names).
