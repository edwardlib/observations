  """Pearson and Lee's data on the heights of parents and children classified b
  y gender

  Wachsmuth et. al (2003) noticed that a loess smooth through Galton's
  data on heights of mid-parents and their offspring exhibited a slightly
  non-linear trend, and asked whether this might be due to Galton having
  pooled the heights of fathers and mothers and sons and daughters in
  constructing his tables and graphs.

  To answer this question, they used analogous data from English families
  at about the same time, tabulated by Karl Pearson and Alice Lee (1896,
  1903), but where the heights of parents and children were each
  classified by gender of the parent.

  A frequency data frame with 746 observations on the following 6
  variables.

  `child`
      child height in inches, a numeric vector

  `parent`
      parent height in inches, a numeric vector

  `frequency`
      a numeric vector

  `gp`
      a factor with levels `fd` `fs` `md` `ms`

  `par`
      a factor with levels `Father` `Mother`

  `chl`
      a factor with levels `Daughter` `Son`
