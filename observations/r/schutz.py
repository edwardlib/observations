  """The Schutz correlation matrix example from Shapiro and ten Berge

  Shapiro and ten Berge use the Schutz correlation matrix as an example
  for Minimum Rank Factor Analysis. The Schutz data set is also a nice
  example of how normal minres or maximum likelihood will lead to a
  Heywood case, but minrank factoring will not.

  The format is: num [1:9, 1:9] 1 0.8 0.28 0.29 0.41 0.38 0.44 0.4 0.41
  0.8 ... - attr(\*, "dimnames")=List of 2 ..$ :1] "Word meaning" "Odd
  Words" "Boots" "Hatchets" ... ..$ : chr [1:9] "V1" "V2" "V3" "V4" ...

  Uni-factor tests. Educational and Psychological Measurement, 48,
  873-875.

  Args:

    path: str.
      Path to directory which either stores file or otherwise file will
      be downloaded and extracted there.
      Filename is `schutz.csv`.

  Returns:

    Tuple of np.ndarray `x_train` with 9 rows and 9 columns and
    dictionary `metadata` of column headers (feature names).
