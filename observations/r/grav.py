  """Acceleration Due to Gravity

  The `gravity` data frame has 81 rows and 2 columns.

  The `grav` data set has 26 rows and 2 columns.

  Between May 1934 and July 1935, the National Bureau of Standards in
  Washington D.C. conducted a series of experiments to estimate the
  acceleration due to gravity, *g*, at Washington. Each experiment
  produced a number of replicate estimates of *g* using the same
  methodology. Although the basic method remained the same for all
  experiments, that of the reversible pendulum, there were changes in
  configuration.

  The `gravity` data frame contains the data from all eight experiments.
  The `grav` data frame contains the data from the experiments 7 and 8.
  The data are expressed as deviations from 980.000 in centimetres per
  second squared.

  This data frame contains the following columns:

  `g`
      The deviation of the estimate from 980.000 centimetres per second
      squared.

  `series`
      A factor describing from which experiment the estimate was derived.

  The data were obtained from

  Cressie, N. (1982) Playing safe with misweighted means. *Journal of the
  American Statistical Association*, **77**, 754â€“759.

  Args:

    path: str.
      Path to directory which either stores file or otherwise file will
      be downloaded and extracted there.
      Filename is `grav.csv`.

  Returns:

    Tuple of np.ndarray `x_train` with 26 rows and 2 columns and
    dictionary `metadata` of column headers (feature names).
