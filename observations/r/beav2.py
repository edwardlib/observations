def beav2(path):
  """Body Temperature Series of Beaver 2

  Reynolds (1994) describes a small part of a study of the long-term
  temperature dynamics of beaver *Castor canadensis* in north-central
  Wisconsin. Body temperature was measured by telemetry every 10 minutes
  for four females, but data from a one period of less than a day for each
  of two animals is used there.

  The `beav2` data frame has 100 rows and 4 columns. This data frame
  contains the following columns:

  `day`
      Day of observation (in days since the beginning of 1990), November
      3â€“4.

  `time`
      Time of observation, in the form `0330` for 3.30am.

  `temp`
      Measured body temperature in degrees Celsius.

  `activ`
      Indicator of activity outside the retreat.

  Returns:

    Tuple of np.ndarray `x_train` with 100 rows and 4 columns and
    dictionary `metadata` of column headers (feature names).
