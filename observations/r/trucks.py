  """Truck Accidents Data

  Data from a study in England in two periods from November 1969 to
  October 1971 and November 1971 to October 1973. A new compulsory safety
  measure for trucks was introduced in October 1971. Therefore, the
  question is whether the safety measure had an effect on the number of
  accidents and on the point of collision on the truck.

  A data frame with 24 observations on 5 variables.

  Freq
      frequency of accidents involving trucks.

  period
      factor indicating time period (before, after) 1971-11-01.

  collision
      factor indicating whether the collision was in the back or forward
      (including the front and the sides) of the truck (back, forward).

  parked
      factor indicating whether the truck was parked (yes, no).

  light
      factor indicating light conditions: day light (daylight), night on
      an illuminated road (night, illuminate), night on a dark road
      (night, dark).
