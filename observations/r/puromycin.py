def puromycin(path):
  """Reaction Velocity of an Enzymatic Reaction

  The `Puromycin` data frame has 23 rows and 3 columns of the reaction
  velocity versus substrate concentration in an enzymatic reaction
  involving untreated cells or cells treated with Puromycin.

  This data frame contains the following columns:

  `conc`
      a numeric vector of substrate concentrations (ppm)

  `rate`
      a numeric vector of instantaneous reaction rates (counts/min/min)

  `state`
      a factor with levels `treated` `untreated`
