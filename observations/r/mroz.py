  This data frame contains the following columns:

  lfp
      labor-force participation; a factor with levels: `no`; `yes`.

  k5
      number of children 5 years old or younger.

  k618
      number of children 6 to 18 years old.

  age
      in years.

  wc
      wife's college attendance; a factor with levels: `no`; `yes`.

  hc
      husband's college attendance; a factor with levels: `no`; `yes`.

  lwg
      log expected wage rate; for women in the labor force, the actual
      wage rate; for women not in the labor force, an imputed value based
      on the regression of `lwg` on the other variables.

  inc
      family income exclusive of wife's income.
