  """Growth of CRAN

  Data casually collected on the number of packages on the Comprehensive R
  Archive Network (CRAN) at different dates.

  NOTE: This could change in the future. See Details below.

  A `data.frame` containing:

  Version
      an ordered factor of the R version number primarily in use at the
      time. This was taken from archives of the major releases at
    https://svn.r-project.org/R/branches/R-1-3-patches/tests/internet.Rout.sa
  ve,
      ...
    https://svn.r-project.org/R/branches/R-3-1-branch/tests/internet.Rout.sav
  e

  Date
      an object of class `Date` giving the date on which the count of
      the number of CRAN packages was determined.

  Packages
      an integer number of packages on the CRAN mirror checked on the
      indicated `Date`.

  Source
      A factor giving the source (person) who collected the data.

      Path to directory which either stores file or otherwise file will
      be downloaded and extracted there.
      Filename is `cran_packages.csv`.

  Returns:

    Tuple of np.ndarray `x_train` with 29 rows and 4 columns and
    dictionary `metadata` of column headers (feature names).
