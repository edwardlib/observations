  """Sugar-cane Disease Data

  The `cane` data frame has 180 rows and 5 columns. The data frame
  represents a randomized block design with 45 varieties of sugar-cane and
  4 blocks.

  This data frame contains the following columns:

  `n`
      The total number of shoots in each plot.

  `r`
      The number of diseased shoots.

  `x`
      The number of pieces of the stems, out of 50, planted in each plot.

  `var`
      A factor indicating the variety of sugar-cane in each plot.

  `block`
      A factor for the blocks.

  The data were kindly supplied by Dr. C.G.B. Demetrio of Escola Superior
  de Agricultura, Universidade de Sao Paolo, Brazil.

  Args:

    path: str.
      Path to directory which either stores file or otherwise file will
      be downloaded and extracted there.
      Filename is `cane.csv`.

  Returns:

    Tuple of np.ndarray `x_train` with 180 rows and 5 columns and
    dictionary `metadata` of column headers (feature names).
