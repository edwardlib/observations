  """Wool data

  This is a three-factor experiment with each factor at three levels, for
  a total of 27 runs. Samples of worsted yarn were with different levels
  of the three factors were given a cyclic load until the sample failed.
  The goal is to understand how cycles to failure depends on the factors.

  This data frame contains the following columns:

  len
      length of specimen (250, 300, 350 mm)

  amp
      amplitude of loading cycle (8, 9, 10 min)

  load
      load (40, 45, 50g)

  cycles
      number of cycles until failure

  Args:

    path: str.
      Path to directory which either stores file or otherwise file will
      be downloaded and extracted there.
      Filename is `wool1.csv`.

  Returns:

    Tuple of np.ndarray `x_train` with 27 rows and 4 columns and
    dictionary `metadata` of column headers (feature names).
