  """Anesthetic Effectiveness

  Thirty patients were given an anesthetic agent maintained at a
  predetermined level (conc) for 15 minutes before making an incision. It
  was then noted whether the patient moved, i.e. jerked or twisted.

  This data frame contains the following columns:

  move
      a binary numeric vector coded for patient movement (0 = no movement,
      1 = movement)

  conc
      anesthetic concentration

  logconc
      logarithm of concentration

  nomove
      the complement of move

  unknown

  Args:

    path: str.
      Path to directory which either stores file or otherwise file will
      be downloaded and extracted there.
      Filename is `anesthetic.csv`.

  Returns:

    Tuple of np.ndarray `x_train` with 30 rows and 4 columns and
    dictionary `metadata` of column headers (feature names).
