  """Smoking Deaths Among Doctors

  The `breslow` data frame has 10 rows and 5 columns.

  In 1961 Doll and Hill sent out a questionnaire to all men on the British
  Medical Register enquiring about their smoking habits. Almost 70% of
  such men replied. Death certificates were obtained for medical
  practitioners and causes of death were assigned on the basis of these
  certificates. The `breslow` data set contains the person-years of
  observations and deaths from coronary artery disease accumulated during
  the first ten years of the study.

  This data frame contains the following columns:

  `age`
      The mid-point of the 10 year age-group for the doctors.

  `smoke`
      An indicator of whether the doctors smoked (1) or not (0).

  `n`
      The number of person-years in the category.

  `y`
      The number of deaths attributed to coronary artery disease.

  `ns`
      The number of smoker years in the category (`smoke*n`).

  The data were obtained from

  Breslow, N.E. (1985) Cohort Analysis in Epidemiology. In *A Celebration
  of Statistics* A.C. Atkinson and S.E. Fienberg (editors), 109â€“143.
