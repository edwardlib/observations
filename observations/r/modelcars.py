  """Model Car Data

  The `modelcars` data frame has 12 rows and 2 columns. The data are for
  an experiment in which a model car was released three times at each of
  four different distances up a 20 degree ramp. The experimenter recorded
  distances traveled from the bottom of the ramp across a concrete floor.

  This data frame contains the following columns:

  distance.traveled
      a numeric vector consisting of the lengths traveled (in cm)

  starting.point
      a numeric vector consisting of the distance of the starting point
      from the top of the ramp (in cm)

  Args:

    path: str.
      Path to directory which either stores file or otherwise file will
      be downloaded and extracted there.
      Filename is `modelcars.csv`.

  Returns:

    Tuple of np.ndarray `x_train` with 12 rows and 2 columns and
    dictionary `metadata` of column headers (feature names).
