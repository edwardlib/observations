  """Cancer Remission and Cell Activity

  This data frame contains the following columns:

  `LI`

  `m`
      The number of patients in each group (all values are actually 1
      here).

  `r`
      The number of patients (out of `m`) who went into remission.

  The data were obtained from

  Freeman, D.H. (1987) *Applied Categorical Data Analysis*. Marcel Dekker.

  Args:

    path: str.
      Path to directory which either stores file or otherwise file will
      be downloaded and extracted there.
      Filename is `remission.csv`.

  Returns:

    Tuple of np.ndarray `x_train` with 27 rows and 3 columns and
    dictionary `metadata` of column headers (feature names).
