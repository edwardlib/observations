  """The Insurance Company (TIC) Benchmark

  The data contains 5822 real customer records. Each record consists of 86
  variables, containing sociodemographic data (variables 1-43) and product
  ownership (variables 44-86). The sociodemographic data is derived from
  zip codes. All customers living in areas with the same zip code have the
  same sociodemographic attributes. Variable 86 (`Purchase`) indicates
  whether the customer purchased a caravan insurance policy. Further
  information on the individual variables can be obtained at
  http://www.liacs.nl/~putten/library/cc2000/data.html

  A data frame with 5822 observations on 86 variables.

  The data was originally supplied by Sentient Machine Research and was
  used in the CoIL Challenge 2000.

  Args:

    path: str.
      Path to directory which either stores file or otherwise file will
      be downloaded and extracted there.
