  """Insect Damages on Carrots

  The damage carrots data set from Phelps (1982) was used by McCullagh and
  Nelder (1989) in order to illustrate diagnostic techniques because of
  the presence of an outlier. In a soil experiment trial with three
  blocks, eight levels of insecticide were applied and the carrots were
  tested for insect damage.

  A data frame with 24 observations on the following 4 variables.

  success
      integer giving the number of carrots with insect damage.

  total
      integer giving the total number of carrots per experimental unit.

  logdose
      a numeric vector giving log(dose) values (eight different levels
      only).

  block
      factor with levels `B1` to `B3`

  | Phelps, K. (1982). Use of the complementary log-log function to
    describe doseresponse relationships in insecticide evaluation field
    trials.

  Args:

    path: str.
      Path to directory which either stores file or otherwise file will
      be downloaded and extracted there.
      Filename is `carrots.csv`.

  Returns:

    Tuple of np.ndarray `x_train` with 24 rows and 4 columns and
    dictionary `metadata` of column headers (feature names).
