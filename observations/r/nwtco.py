  """Data from the National Wilm's Tumor Study

  Measurement error example. Tumor histology predicts survival, but
  prediction is stronger with central lab histology than with the local
  institution determination.

  A data frame with 4028 observations on the following 9 variables.

  `seqno`
      id number

  `instit`
      Histology from local institution

  `histol`
      Histology from central lab

  `stage`
      Disease stage

  `study`
      study

  `rel`
      indicator for relapse

  `edrel`
      time to relapse

  `age`
      age in months

  `in.subcohort`
      Included in the subcohort for the example in the paper

  Args:

    path: str.
      Path to directory which either stores file or otherwise file will
      be downloaded and extracted there.
      Filename is `nwtco.csv`.

  Returns:

    Tuple of np.ndarray `x_train` with 4028 rows and 9 columns and
    dictionary `metadata` of column headers (feature names).
