  """Airbag and other influences on accident fatalities

  US data, for 1997-2002, from police-reported car crashes in which there
  is a harmful event (people or property), and from which at least one
  vehicle was towed. Data are restricted to front-seat occupants, include
  only a subset of the variables recorded, and are restricted in other
  ways also.

  A data frame with 26217 observations on the following 15 variables.

  `dvcat`
      ordered factor with levels (estimated impact speeds) `1-9km/h`,
      `10-24`, `25-39`, `40-54`, `55+`

  `weight`
      Observation weights, albeit of uncertain accuracy, designed to
      account for varying sampling probabilities.

  `dead`
      factor with levels `alive` `dead`

  `airbag`
      a factor with levels `none` `airbag`

  `seatbelt`
      a factor with levels `none` `belted`

  `frontal`
      a numeric vector; 0 = non-frontal, 1=frontal impact

  `sex`
      a factor with levels `f` `m`

  `ageOFocc`
      age of occupant in years

  `yearacc`
      year of accident

  `yearVeh`
      Year of model of vehicle; a numeric vector

  `abcat`
      Did one or more (driver or passenger) airbag(s) deploy? This factor
      has levels `deploy` `nodeploy` `unavail`

  `occRole`
      a factor with levels `driver` `pass`

  `deploy`
      a numeric vector: 0 if an airbag was unavailable or did not deploy;
      1 if one or more bags deployed.

  `injSeverity`
      a numeric vector; 0:none, 1:possible injury, 2:no incapacity,
      3:incapacity, 4:killed; 5:unknown, 6:prior death

  `caseid`
      character, created by pasting together the populations sampling
      unit, the case number, and the vehicle number. Within each year, use
      this to uniquely identify the vehicle.
