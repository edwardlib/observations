  """Biochemical Oxygen Demand

  The `BOD` data frame has 6 rows and 2 columns giving the biochemical
  oxygen demand versus time in an evaluation of water quality.

  This data frame contains the following columns:

  `Time`
      A numeric vector giving the time of the measurement (days).

  `demand`
      A numeric vector giving the biochemical oxygen demand (mg/l).

  Bates, D.M. and Watts, D.G. (1988), *Nonlinear Regression Analysis and
  Its Applications*, Wiley, Appendix A1.4.

  Originally from Marske (1967), *Biochemical Oxygen Demand Data
  Interpretation Using Sum of Squares Surface* M.Sc. Thesis, University of
  Wisconsin â€“ Madison.

  Args:

    path: str.
      Path to directory which either stores file or otherwise file will
      be downloaded and extracted there.
      Filename is `bod.csv`.

  Returns:

    Tuple of np.ndarray `x_train` with 6 rows and 2 columns and
    dictionary `metadata` of column headers (feature names).
