  """Spatial Location of Bramble Canes

  The `brambles` data frame has 823 rows and 3 columns.

  The location of living bramble canes in a 9m square plot was recorded.
  We take 9m to be the unit of distance so that the plot can be thought of
  as a unit square. The bramble canes were also classified by their age.

  This data frame contains the following columns:

  `x`
      The x coordinate of the position of the cane in the plot.

  `y`
      The y coordinate of the position of the cane in the plot.

  `age`
      The age classification of the canes; `0` indicates a newly emerged
      cane, `1` indicates a one year old cane and `2` indicates a two
      year old cane.

  The data were obtained from

  Diggle, P.J. (1983) *Statistical Analysis of Spatial Point Patterns*.
  Academic Press.

  Args:

    path: str.
      Path to directory which either stores file or otherwise file will
      be downloaded and extracted there.
      Filename is `brambles.csv`.

  Returns:

    Tuple of np.ndarray `x_train` with 823 rows and 3 columns and
    dictionary `metadata` of column headers (feature names).
