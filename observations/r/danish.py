  """Danish Fire Insurance Claims

  These data describe large fire insurance claims in Denmark from Thursday
  3rd January 1980 until Monday 31st December 1990. The data are contained
  in a numeric vector. The dates of each observation are contained in a
  `times` attribute, which is an object of class `"POSIXct"` (see
  `DateTimeClasses`). They were supplied by Mette Rytgaard of Copenhagen
  Re. Note that these data form an irregular time series.

  A numeric vector containing 2167 observations, with a `times`

  Args:

    path: str.
      Path to directory which either stores file or otherwise file will
      be downloaded and extracted there.
      Filename is `danish.csv`.

  Returns:

    Tuple of np.ndarray `x_train` with 2167 rows and 1 columns and
    dictionary `metadata` of column headers (feature names).
