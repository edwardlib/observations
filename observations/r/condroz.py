  different communities of the Condroz region in Belgium. The data pertain
  to a subset of 428 samples with a pH-value between 7.0 and 7.5.

  A data frame with 428 observations on the following 2 variables.

  `Ca`
      Calcium content of the soil sample

  `pH`
      pH value of the soil sample

  Hubert and Vandervieren (2006), p. 10. This dataset is also studied in
  Vandewalle et al. (2004).

  Args:

    path: str.
      Path to directory which either stores file or otherwise file will
      be downloaded and extracted there.
      Filename is `condroz.csv`.

  Returns:
