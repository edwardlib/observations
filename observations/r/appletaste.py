def appletaste(path):
  """Tasting experiment that compared four apple varieties

  Each of 20 tasters each assessed three out of the four varieties. The
  experiment was conducted according to a balanced incomplete block
  design.

  A data frame with 60 observations on the following 3 variables.

  aftertaste
      a numeric vector

  Apple samples were rated for `aftertaste`, by making a mark on a
  continuous scale that ranged from 0 (extreme dislike) to 150 (like very
  much).

  panelist
      a factor with levels `a` `b` `c` `d` `e` `f` `g` `h`
      `i` `j` `k` `l` `m` `n` `o` `p` `q` `r` `s`
      `t`

  product
      a factor with levels `298` `493` `649` `937`

  Args:

    path: str.
      Path to directory which either stores file or otherwise file will
      be downloaded and extracted there.
      Filename is `appletaste.csv`.

  Returns:

    Tuple of np.ndarray `x_train` with 60 rows and 3 columns and
    dictionary `metadata` of column headers (feature names).
