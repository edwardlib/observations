  """Yield of dyestuff by batch

  The `Dyestuff` data frame provides the yield of dyestuff (Naphthalene
  Black 12B) from 5 different preparations from each of 6 different batchs
  of an intermediate product (H-acid). The `Dyestuff2` data were
  generated data in the same structure but with a large residual variance
  relative to the batch variance.

  Data frames, each with 30 observations on the following 2 variables.

  `Batch`
      a factor indicating the batch of the intermediate product from which
      the preparation was created.

  `Yield`
      the yield of dyestuff from the preparation (grams of standard
      color).
