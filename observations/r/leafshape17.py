  """Subset of Leaf Shape Data Set

  The `leafshape17` data frame has 61 rows and 8 columns. These are leaf
  length, width and petiole measurements taken at several sites in
  Australia. This is a subset of the `leafshape` data frame.

  This data frame contains the following columns:

  bladelen
      leaf length (in mm)

  petiole
      a numeric vector

  bladewid
      leaf width (in mm)

  latitude
      latitude

  logwid
      natural logarithm of width

  logpet
      logarithm of petiole measurement

  loglen
      logarithm of length

  arch
      leaf architecture (0 = orthotropic, 1 = plagiotropic)

  King, D.A. and Maindonald, J.H. 1999. Tree architecture in relation to
  leaf dimensions and tree stature in temperate and tropical rain forests.

  Args:

    path: str.
      Path to directory which either stores file or otherwise file will
      be downloaded and extracted there.
      Filename is `leafshape17.csv`.

  Returns:

    Tuple of np.ndarray `x_train` with 61 rows and 8 columns and
    dictionary `metadata` of column headers (feature names).
