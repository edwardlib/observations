def heights(path):
  """A data.frame of the Galton (1888) height and cubit data set.

  Francis Galton introduced the 'co-relation' in 1888 with a paper
  discussing how to measure the relationship between two variables. His
  primary example was the relationship between height and forearm length.
  The data table (`cubits`) is taken from Galton (1888). Unfortunately,
  there seem to be some errors in the original data table in that the
  marginal totals do not match the table.

  The data frame, `heights`, is converted from this table using
  `table2df`.

  A data frame with 348 observations on the following 2 variables.

  `height`
      Height in inches

  `cubit`
      Forearm length in inches

  Galton (1888)

  Args:

    path: str.
      Path to directory which either stores file or otherwise file will
      be downloaded and extracted there.
      Filename is `heights.csv`.

  Returns:

    Tuple of np.ndarray `x_train` with 348 rows and 2 columns and
    dictionary `metadata` of column headers (feature names).
