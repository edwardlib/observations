  """Data from an Oats Field Trial

  The yield of oats from a split-plot field trial using three varieties
  and four levels of manurial treatment. The experiment was laid out in 6
  blocks of 3 main plots, each split into 4 sub-plots. The varieties were
  applied to the main plots and the manurial treatments to the sub-plots.

  This data frame contains the following columns:

  `B`
      Blocks, levels I, II, III, IV, V and VI.

  `V`
      Varieties, 3 levels.

  `N`
      Nitrogen (manurial) treatment, levels 0.0cwt, 0.2cwt, 0.4cwt and
      0.6cwt, showing the application in cwt/acre.

  `Y`
      Yields in 1/4lbs per sub-plot, each of area 1/80 acre.
