  """Michelson's Speed of Light Data

  Measurements of the speed of light in air, made between 5th June and 2nd
  July, 1879. The data consists of five experiments, each consisting of 20
  consecutive runs. The response is the speed of light in km/s, less
  299000. The currently accepted value, on this scale of measurement, is
  734.5.

  The data frame contains the following components:

  `Expt`
      The experiment number, from 1 to 5.

  `Run`
      The run number within each experiment.

  `Speed`
      Speed-of-light measurement.

  S. M. Stigler (1977) Do robust estimators work with real data? *Annals
  of Statistics* **5**, 1055â€“1098.

  Args:

    path: str.
      Path to directory which either stores file or otherwise file will
      be downloaded and extracted there.
      Filename is `michelson1.csv`.

  Returns:

    Tuple of np.ndarray `x_train` with 100 rows and 3 columns and
    dictionary `metadata` of column headers (feature names).
