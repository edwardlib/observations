  """Labour Training Evaluation Data

  The `nswdemo` data frame contains 722 rows and 10 columns. These data
  are pertinent to an investigation of the way that earnings changed,
  between 1974-1975 and 1978, for an experimental treatment who were given
  job training as compared with a control group who did not receive such
  training.

  The `psid1` data set is an alternative non-experimental "control"
  group. `psid2` and `psid3` are subsets of `psid1`, designed to be
  better matched to the experimental data than `psid1`. Note also the
  `cps1`, `cps2` and `cps3` datasets (DAAGxtras) that have been
  proposed as non-experimental controls.

  This data frame contains the following columns:

  trt
      a numeric vector identifying the study in which the subjects were
      enrolled (0 = Control, 1 = treated).

  age
      age (in years).

  educ
      years of education.

  black
      (0 = not black, 1 = black).

  hisp
      (0 = not hispanic, 1 = hispanic).

  marr
      (0 = not married, 1 = married).

  nodeg
      (0 = completed high school, 1 = dropout).

  re74
      real earnings in 1974.

  re75
      real earnings in 1975.

  re78
      real earnings in 1978.
