  A data frame with 153338 observations on the following 17 variables.

  `caseid`
      a character vector: identifies the vehicle

  `state`
      a numeric vector. See the FARS website for details

  `age`
      a numeric vector; 998=not reported; 999=not known

  `airbag`
      a numeric vector

  `injury`
      a numeric vector

  `restraint`
      a numeric vector

  `sex`
      1=male, 2=female, 9=unknown

  `inimpact`
      a numeric vector

  `modelyr`
      a numeric vector

  `airbagAvail`
      a factor with levels `no` `yes` `NA-code`

  `airbagDeploy`
      a factor with levels `no` `yes` `NA-code`

  `Restraint`
      a factor with levels `no` `yes` `NA-code`

  `D_injury`
      a numeric vector

  `D_airbagAvail`
      a factor with levels `no` `yes` `NA-code`

  `D_airbagDeploy`
      a factor with levels `no` `yes` `NA-code`

  `year`
      year of accident

  ~~~~~~~

  Data is for automabiles where the right passenger seat was occupied,
  with one observation for each such passenger. Observations for vehicles
  where the most harmful event was a fire or explosion or immersion or gas
  inhalation, or where someone fell or jumped from the vehicle, are
  omitted. Data are limited to vehicle body types 1 to 19,48,49,61, or 62.
  This excludes large trucks, pickup trucks, vans and buses. The 2009 and
  2010 data does not include information on whether airbags were
  installed.
