  """Foot measurements in children

  These data were collected by a statistician, Mary C. Meyer, in a fourth
  grade classroom in Ann Arbor, MI, in October 1997. They are a
  convenience sample â€” the kids who were in the fourth grade.

  A data frame with 39 observations on the following variables.

  -  `name` a factor with levels corresponding to the name of each child

  -  `birthmonth` the month of birth

  -  `birthyear` the year of birth

  -  `length` length of longer foot (in cm)

  -  `width` width of longer foot (in cm)

  -  `sex` a factor with levels `B` `G`

  -  `biggerfoot` a factor with levels `L` `R`

  -  `domhand` a factor with levels `L` `R`

  Args:

    path: str.
      Path to directory which either stores file or otherwise file will
      be downloaded and extracted there.
      Filename is `kids_feet.csv`.

  Returns:

    Tuple of np.ndarray `x_train` with 39 rows and 8 columns and
    dictionary `metadata` of column headers (feature names).
