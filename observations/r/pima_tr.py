  """Diabetes in Pima Indian Women

  A population of women who were at least 21 years old, of Pima Indian
  heritage and living near Phoenix, Arizona, was tested for diabetes
  according to World Health Organization criteria. The data were collected
  by the US National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney
  Diseases. We used the 532 complete records after dropping the (mainly
  missing) data on serum insulin.

  These data frames contains the following columns:

  `npreg`
      number of pregnancies.

  `glu`
      plasma glucose concentration in an oral glucose tolerance test.

  `bp`
      diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg).

  `skin`
      triceps skin fold thickness (mm).

  `bmi`
      body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)\ *\\^2*).

  `ped`
      diabetes pedigree function.

  `age`
      age in years.

  `type`
      `Yes` or `No`, for diabetic according to WHO criteria.
