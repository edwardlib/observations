  """Iron Content Measurements

  The `ironslag` data frame has 53 rows and 2 columns. Two methods for
  measuring the iron content in samples of slag were compared, a chemical
  and a magnetic method. The chemical method requires greater effort than
  the magnetic method.

  This data frame contains the following columns:

  chemical
      a numeric vector containing the measurements coming from the
      chemical method

  magnetic
      a numeric vector containing the measurments coming from the magnetic
      method
