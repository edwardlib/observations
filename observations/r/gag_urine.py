  """Level of GAG in Urine of Children

  Data were collected on the concentration of a chemical GAG in the urine
  of 314 children aged from zero to seventeen years. The aim of the study
  was to produce a chart to help a paediatrican to assess if a child's GAG
  concentration is ‘normal’.

  This data frame contains the following columns:

  `Age`
      age of child in years.

  `GAG`
      concentration of GAG (the units have been lost).

  Mrs Susan Prosser, Paediatrics Department, University of Oxford, via
  Department of Statistics Consulting Service.

  Args:

    path: str.
      Path to directory which either stores file or otherwise file will
      be downloaded and extracted there.
      Filename is `gag_urine.csv`.

  Returns:

    Tuple of np.ndarray `x_train` with 314 rows and 2 columns and
    dictionary `metadata` of column headers (feature names).
