  """Toxicity of Carboxylic Acids Data

  The aim of the experiment was to predict the toxicity of carboxylic
  acids on the basis of several molecular descriptors.

  A data frame with 38 observations on the following 10 variables which
  are attributes for carboxylic acids:

  `toxicity`
      aquatic toxicity, defined as *log(IGC50^(-1))*; typically the
      “response”.

  `logKow`
      *log Kow*, the partition coefficient

  `pKa`
      pKa: the dissociation constant

  `ELUMO`
      **E**\ nergy of the **l**\ owest **u**\ noccupied **m**\ olecular
      **o**\ rbital

  `Ecarb`
      Electrotopological state of the **carb**\ oxylic group

  `Emet`
      Electrotopological state of the **met**\ hyl group

  `RM`
      Molar refractivity

  `IR`
      Refraction index

  `Ts`
      Surface tension

  `P`
      Polarizability

  The website accompanying the MMY-book:
  http://www.wiley.com/legacy/wileychi/robust_statistics

  Args:

    path: str.
      Path to directory which either stores file or otherwise file will
      be downloaded and extracted there.
      Filename is `toxicity.csv`.

  Returns:

    Tuple of np.ndarray `x_train` with 38 rows and 10 columns and
    dictionary `metadata` of column headers (feature names).
