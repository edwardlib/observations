  """Rare and Endangered Plant Species

  These data were taken from species lists for South Australia, Victoria
  and Tasmania. Species were classified as CC, CR, RC and RR, with C
  denoting common and R denoting rare. The first code relates to South
  Australia and Victoria, and the second to Tasmania. They were further
  classified by habitat according to the Victorian register, where D = dry
  only, W = wet only, and WD = wet or dry.

  The format is: chr "rareplants"
