def kidney(path):
  """Kidney catheter data

  Data on the recurrence times to infection, at the point of insertion of
  the catheter, for kidney patients using portable dialysis equipment.
  Catheters may be removed for reasons other than infection, in which case
  the observation is censored. Each patient has exactly 2 observations.

  This data has often been used to illustrate the use of random effects
  (frailty) in a survival model. However, one of the males (id 21) is a
  large outlier, with much longer survival than his peers. If this
  observation is removed no evidence remains for a random subject effect.

  frail:

  Args:

      Filename is `kidney.csv`.

  Returns:
