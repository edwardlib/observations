  """Cancer drug data use to provide an example of the use of the skew power di
  stributions.

  A portion of an experiment to determine the limit of blank/limit of
  detection in a biochemical assay.

  A data frame with 84 observations on the following 9 variables.

  `pool`
      a factor with levels `1` `2` `3` `4` `5` `6` `7` `8`
      `9` `10` `11` `12` denoting the 12 pools used in the
      experiment; each pool had a different level of drug.

  `I1L1`
      a numeric vector giving the measured concentration in pmol/L of drug
      in the assay

  `I1L2`
      a numeric vector giving the measured concentration in pmol/L of drug
      in the assay

  `I2L1`
      a numeric vector giving the measured concentration in pmol/L of drug
      in the assay

  `I2L2`
      a numeric vector giving the measured concentration in pmol/L of drug
      in the assay

  `I3L1`
      a numeric vector giving the measured concentration in pmol/L of drug
      in the assay

  `I3L2`
      a numeric vector giving the measured concentration in pmol/L of drug
      in the assay

  `I4L1`
      a numeric vector giving the measured concentration in pmol/L of drug
      in the assay

  `I4L2`
      a numeric vector giving the measured concentration in pmol/L of drug
      in the assay

  Used as an illustrative example for Box-Cox type transformations with
  negative readings in Hawkins and Weisberg (2015). For examples of its
  use, see `skewPower`.

  Args:

    path: str.
      Path to directory which either stores file or otherwise file will
      be downloaded and extracted there.
      Filename is `lo_bd.csv`.

  Returns:

    Tuple of np.ndarray `x_train` with 84 rows and 9 columns and
    dictionary `metadata` of column headers (feature names).
