  """Post-Coma Recovery of IQ

  The `Wong` data frame has 331 row and 7 columns. The observations are
  longitudinal data on recovery of IQ after comas of varying duration for
  200 subjects.

  This data frame contains the following columns:

  `id`
      patient ID number.

  `days`
      number of days post coma at which IQs were measured.

  `duration`
      duration of the coma in days.

  `sex`
      a factor with levels `Female` and `Male`.

  `age`
      in years at the time of injury.

  `piq`
      performance (i.e., mathematical) IQ.

  `viq`
      verbal IQ.

  Wong, P. P., Monette, G., and Weiner, N. I. (2001) Mathematical models
  of cognitive recovery. *Brain Injury*, **15**, 519â€“530.

  Args:

    path: str.
      Path to directory which either stores file or otherwise file will
      be downloaded and extracted there.
      Filename is `wong.csv`.

  Returns:

    Tuple of np.ndarray `x_train` with 331 rows and 7 columns and
    dictionary `metadata` of column headers (feature names).
