  """Classical N, P, K Factorial Experiment

  A classical N, P, K (nitrogen, phosphate, potassium) factorial
  experiment on the growth of peas conducted on 6 blocks. Each half of a
  fractional factorial design confounding the NPK interaction was used on
  3 of the plots.

  The `npk` data frame has 24 rows and 5 columns:

  `block`
      which block (label 1 to 6).

  `N`
      indicator (0/1) for the application of nitrogen.

  `P`
      indicator (0/1) for the application of phosphate.

  `K`
      indicator (0/1) for the application of potassium.

  `yield`
      Yield of peas, in pounds/plot (the plots were (1/70) acre).

  Imperial College, London, M.Sc. exercise sheet.

  Args:

    path: str.
      Path to directory which either stores file or otherwise file will
      be downloaded and extracted there.
      Filename is `npk.csv`.

  Returns:

    Tuple of np.ndarray `x_train` with 24 rows and 5 columns and
    dictionary `metadata` of column headers (feature names).
