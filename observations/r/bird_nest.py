  Data on bird nests

  A dataset with 84 observations on the following 12 variables.

  `Species`

  Latin species name

  `Common`

  Common species name

  `Page`

  Page in a bird manual describing the species

  `Length`

  Mean body length for the species (in cm)

  `Nesttype`

  Type of nest

  `Location`

  Location of nest

  `No.eggs`

  Number of eggs

  `Color`

  a numeric vector

  `Incubate`

  Mean length of time (in days) the species incubates eggs in the nest

  `Nestling`

  Mean length of time (in days) the species cares for babies in the nest
  until fledged

  `Totcare`

  Total care time = Incubate+Nestling

  `Closed`

  1=closed nest (pendant, spherical, cavity, crevice, burrow), 0=open nest
