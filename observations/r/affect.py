  """Two data sets of affect and arousal scores as a function of personality an
  d movie conditions

  A recurring question in the study of affect is the proper dimensionality
  and the relationship to various personality dimensions. Here is a data
  set taken from two studies of mood and arousal using movies to induce
  affective states.

  Data collected at the Personality, Motivation, and Cognition Laboratory,
  Northwestern University.

  Args:

    path: str.
      Path to directory which either stores file or otherwise file will
      be downloaded and extracted there.
      Filename is `affect.csv`.

  Returns:

    Tuple of np.ndarray `x_train` with 330 rows and 20 columns and
    dictionary `metadata` of column headers (feature names).
