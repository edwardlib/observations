  """The Stormer Viscometer Data

  The stormer viscometer measures the viscosity of a fluid by measuring
  the time taken for an inner cylinder in the mechanism to perform a fixed
  number of revolutions in response to an actuating weight. The viscometer
  is calibrated by measuring the time taken with varying weights while the
  mechanism is suspended in fluids of accurately known viscosity. The data
  comes from such a calibration, and theoretical considerations suggest a
  nonlinear relationship between time, weight and viscosity, of the form
  `Time = (B1*Viscosity)/(Weight - B2) + E` where `B1` and `B2` are
  unknown parameters to be estimated, and `E` is error.

  The data frame contains the following components:

  `Viscosity`
      viscosity of fluid.

  `Wt`
      actuating weight.

  `Time`
      time taken.
