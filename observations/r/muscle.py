  """Effect of Calcium Chloride on Muscle Contraction in Rat Hearts

  The purpose of this experiment was to assess the influence of calcium in
  solution on the contraction of heart muscle in rats. The left auricle of
  21 rat hearts was isolated and on several occasions a constant-length
  strip of tissue was electrically stimulated and dipped into various
  concentrations of calcium chloride solution, after which the shortening
  of the strip was accurately measured as the response.

  This data frame contains the following columns:

  `Strip`
      which heart muscle strip was used?

  `Conc`
      concentration of calcium chloride solution, in multiples of 2.2 mM.

  `Length`
      the change in length (shortening) of the strip, (allegedly) in mm.
