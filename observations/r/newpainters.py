  """The Discretized Painter's Data of de Piles

  The original painters data contain the subjective assessment, on a 0 to
  20 integer scale, of 54 classical painters. The newpainters data
  discretizes the subjective assessment by quartiles with thresholds 25%,
  50%, 75%. The painters were assessed on four characteristics:
  composition, drawing, colour and expression. The data is due to the
  Eighteenth century art critic, de Piles.

  A table containing 5 variables ("Composition", "Drawing", "Colour",
  "Expression", and "School") and 54 observations.
