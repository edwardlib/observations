def ethanol(path):
  """Engine exhaust fumes from burning ethanol

  Ethanol fuel was burned in a single-cylinder engine. For various
  settings of the engine compression and equivalence ratio, the emissions
  of nitrogen oxides were recorded.

  A data frame with 88 observations on the following 3 variables.

  NOx
      Concentration of nitrogen oxides (NO and NO2) in micrograms/J.

  C
      Compression ratio of the engine.

  E
      Equivalence ratio–a measure of the richness of the air and ethanol
      fuel mixture.
