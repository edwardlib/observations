  """Jura Quartzite Azimuths on Islay

  The `islay` data frame has 18 rows and 1 columns.

  Measurements were taken of paleocurrent azimuths from the Jura Quartzite
  on the Scottish island of Islay.

  This data frame contains the following column:

  `theta`
      The angle of the azimuth in degrees East of North.

  The data were obtained from

  Hand, D.J., Daly, F., Lunn, A.D., McConway, K.J. and Ostrowski, E.
  (1994) *A Handbook of Small Data Sets*, Chapman and Hall.

  Args:

    path: str.
      Path to directory which either stores file or otherwise file will
      be downloaded and extracted there.
      Filename is `islay.csv`.

  Returns:

    Tuple of np.ndarray `x_train` with 18 rows and 1 columns and
    dictionary `metadata` of column headers (feature names).
