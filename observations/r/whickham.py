  """Data from the Whickham survey

  variables.

     `Alive` `Dead`

  -  `smoker` smoking status at baseline: a factor with levels `No`
     `Yes`

  -  `age` age (in years) at the time of the first survey

  Args:

    path: str.
      Path to directory which either stores file or otherwise file will
      be downloaded and extracted there.
      Filename is `whickham.csv`.

  Returns:

    Tuple of np.ndarray `x_train` with 1314 rows and 3 columns and
