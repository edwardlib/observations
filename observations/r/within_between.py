  """An example of the distinction between within group and between group corre
  lations

  A demonstration that a correlation may be decomposed to a within group
  correlation and a between group correlations and these two correlations
  are independent. Between group correlations are sometimes called
  ecological correlations, the decomposition into within and between group
  correlations is a basic concept in multilevel modeling. This data set
  shows the composite correlations between 9 variables, representing 16
  cases with four groups.

  A data frame with 16 observations on the following 10 variables.

  `Group`
      An example grouping factor.

  `V1`
      A column of 16 observations

  `V2`
      A column of 16 observations

  `V3`
      A column of 16 observations

  `V4`
      A column of 16 observations

  `V5`
      A column of 16 observations

  `V6`
      A column of 16 observations

  `V7`
      A column of 16 observations

  `V8`
      A column of 16 observations

  `V9`
      A column of 16 observations

  The data were created for this example

  Args:

    path: str.
      Path to directory which either stores file or otherwise file will
      be downloaded and extracted there.
      Filename is `within_between.csv`.

  Returns:

    Tuple of np.ndarray `x_train` with 16 rows and 10 columns and
    dictionary `metadata` of column headers (feature names).
