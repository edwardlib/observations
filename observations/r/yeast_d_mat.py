  """Student's (1906) Yeast Cell Counts

  Counts of the number of yeast cells were made each of 400 regions in a
  20 x 20 grid on a microscope slide, comprising a 1 sq. mm. area. This
  experiment was repeated four times, giving samples A, B, C and D.

  Student (1906) used these data to investigate the errors in random
  sampling. He says "there are two sources of error: (a) the drop taken
  may not be representative of the bulk of the liquid; (b) the
  distribution of the cells over the area which is examined is never
  exactly uniform, so that there is an 'error of random sampling.'"

  The data in the paper are provided in the form of discrete frequency
  distributions for the four samples. Each shows the frequency
  distribution squares containing a `count` of 0, 1, 2, ... yeast cells.
  These are combined here in `Yeast`. In addition, he gives a table
  (Table I) showing the actual number of yeast cells counted in the 20 x
  20 grid for sample D, given here as `YeastD.mat`.

  `Yeast`: A frequency data frame with 36 observations on the following
  3 variables, giving the frequencies of

  `sample`
      Sample identifier, a factor with levels `A` `B` `C` `D`

  `count`
      The number of yeast cells counted in a square

  `freq`
      The number of squares with the given `count`

  `YeastD.mat`: A 20 x 20 matrix containing the count of yeast cells in
  each square for sample D.
