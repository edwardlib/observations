  """Breathlessness and Wheeze in Coal Miners

  Data from Ashford & Sowden (1970) given by Agresti (1990) on the
  association between two pulmonary conditions, breathlessness and wheeze,
  in a large sample of coal miners who were smokers with no radiological
  evidence of pneumoconlosis, aged between 20–64 when examined. This data
  is frequently used as an example of fitting models for bivariate, binary
  responses.

  A 3-dimensional table of size 2 x 2 x 9 resulting from cross-tabulating
  variables for 18,282 coal miners. The variables and their levels are as
  follows:

  +------+------------------+-----------------------------------+
  | No   | Name             | Levels                            |
  +------+------------------+-----------------------------------+
  | 1    | Breathlessness   | B, NoB                            |
  +------+------------------+-----------------------------------+
  | 2    | Wheeze           | W, NoW                            |
  +------+------------------+-----------------------------------+
  | 3    | Age              | 20-24, 25-29, 30-34, ..., 60-64   |
