  """11 emotional variables from Burt (1915)

  Cyril Burt reported an early factor analysis with a circumplex structure
  of 11 emotional variables in 1915. 8 of these were subsequently used by
  Harman in his text on factor analysis. Unfortunately, it seems as if
  Burt made a mistake for the matrix is not positive definite. With one
  change from .87 to .81 the matrix is positive definite.

  A correlation matrix based upon 172 "normal school age children aged
  9-12".
