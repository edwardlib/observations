  Seven specimens were sent to 6 laboratories in 3 separate batches and
  each analysed for Analyte. Each analysis was duplicated.

  This data frame contains the following columns:

  `Lab`
      Laboratory, `L1`, `L2`, ..., `L6`.

  `Spc`
      Specimen, `S1`, `S2`, ..., `S7`.

  `Bat`
      Batch, `B1`, `B2`, `B3` (nested within `Spc/Lab`),

  `Conc`
      Concentration of Analyte in *g/kg*.

  Analytical Methods Committee (1987) Recommendations for the conduct and
  interpretation of co-operative trials, *The Analyst* **112**, 679â€“686.

  Args:

    path: str.
      Path to directory which either stores file or otherwise file will
      be downloaded and extracted there.
