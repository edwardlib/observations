  """Urine Analysis Data

  The `urine` data frame has 79 rows and 7 columns.

  79 urine specimens were analyzed in an effort to determine if certain
  physical characteristics of the urine might be related to the formation
  of calcium oxalate crystals.

  This data frame contains the following columns:

  `r`
      Indicator of the presence of calcium oxalate crystals.

  `gravity`
      The specific gravity of the urine.

  `ph`
      The pH reading of the urine.

  `osmo`
      The osmolarity of the urine. Osmolarity is proportional to the
      concentration of molecules in solution.

  `cond`
      The conductivity of the urine. Conductivity is proportional to the
      concentration of charged ions in solution.

  `urea`
      The urea concentration in millimoles per litre.

  `calc`
      The calcium concentration in millimoles per litre.

  The data were obtained from

  Andrews, D.F. and Herzberg, A.M. (1985) *Data: A Collection of Problems
  from Many Fields for the Student and Research Worker*. Springer-Verlag.
