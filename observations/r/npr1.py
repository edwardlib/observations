  """US Naval Petroleum Reserve No. 1 data

  Data on the locations, porosity and permeability (a measure of oil flow)
  on 104 oil wells in the US Naval Petroleum Reserve No. 1 in California.

  This data frame contains the following columns:

  `x`
      x coordinates, in miles (origin unspecified)..

  `y`
      y coordinates, in miles.

  `perm`
      permeability in milli-Darcies.

  `por`
      porosity (%).

  Args:

    path: str.
      Path to directory which either stores file or otherwise file will
      be downloaded and extracted there.
      Filename is `npr1.csv`.

  Returns:

    Tuple of np.ndarray `x_train` with 104 rows and 4 columns and
    dictionary `metadata` of column headers (feature names).
