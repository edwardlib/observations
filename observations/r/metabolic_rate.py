  """Metabolic Rate of Caterpillars

  Body size and metabolic rate of Manduca Sexta caterpillars

  A dataset with 305 observations on the following 7 variables.

  `Computer`

  ID number of the computer used to measure metabolic rate

  `BodySize`

  Size of the caterpillar (in grams)

  `LogBodySize`

  Log (base 10) of BodySize

  `Instar`

  Number from 1 (smallest) to 5 (largest) indicating stage of the
  caterpillar's life

  `CO2ppm`

  Carbon dioxide concentration (in ppm)

  `Mrate`

  Metabolic rate

  `LogMrate`

  Log (base 10) of metablic rate
