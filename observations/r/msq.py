  """75 mood items from the Motivational State Questionnaire for 3896 participa
  nts

  Emotions may be described either as discrete emotions or in dimensional
  terms. The Motivational State Questionnaire (MSQ) was developed to study
  emotions in laboratory and field settings. The data can be well
  described in terms of a two dimensional solution of energy vs tiredness
  and tension versus calmness. Additional items include what time of day
  the data were collected and a few personality questionnaire scores.
