  """Minor Head Injury (Simulated) Data

  The `head.injury` data frame has 3121 rows and 11 columns. The data
  were simulated according to a simple logistic regression model to match
  roughly the clinical characteristics of a sample of individuals who
  suffered minor head injuries.

  This data frame contains the following columns:

  age.65
      age factor (0 = under 65, 1 = over 65).

  amnesia.before
      amnesia before impact (less than 30 minutes = 0, more than 30
      minutes =1).

  basal.skull.fracture
      (0 = no fracture, 1 = fracture).

  GCS.decrease
      Glasgow Coma Scale decrease (0 = no deterioration, 1 =
      deterioration).

  GCS.13
      initial Glasgow Coma Scale (0 = not ‘13’, 1 = ‘13’).

  GCS.15.2hours
      Glasgow Coma Scale after 2 hours (0 = not ‘15’, 1 = '15').

  high.risk
      assessed by clinician as high risk for neurological intervention (0
      = not high risk, 1 = high risk).

  loss.of.consciousness
      (0 = conscious, 1 = loss of consciousness).

  open.skull.fracture
      (0 = no fracture, 1 = fracture)

  vomiting
      (0 = no vomiting, 1 = vomiting)

  clinically.important.brain.injury
      any acute brain finding revealed on CT (0 = not present, 1 =
      present).

  Args:

    path: str.
      Path to directory which either stores file or otherwise file will
      be downloaded and extracted there.
      Filename is `head_injury.csv`.

  Returns:

    Tuple of np.ndarray `x_train` with 3121 rows and 11 columns and
    dictionary `metadata` of column headers (feature names).
