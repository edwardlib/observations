  """Bowley's data on values of British and Irish trade, 1855-1899

  In one of the first statistical textbooks, Arthur Bowley (1901) used
  these data to illustrate an arithmetic and graphical analysis of
  time-series data using the total value of British and Irish exports from
  1855-1899. He presented a line graph of the time-series data,
  supplemented by overlaid line graphs of 3-, 5- and 10-year moving
  averages. His goal was to show that while the initial series showed wide
  variability, moving averages made the series progressively smoother.

  A data frame with 45 observations on the following 2 variables.

  `Year`
      Year, from 1855-1899

  `Value`
      total value of British and Irish exports (millions of Pounds)

  Bowley, A. L. (1901). *Elements of Statistics*. London: P. S. King and
  Son, p. 151-154.

  Digitized from Bowley's graph.

  Args:

    path: str.
      Path to directory which either stores file or otherwise file will
      be downloaded and extracted there.
      Filename is `bowley.csv`.

  Returns:

    Tuple of np.ndarray `x_train` with 45 rows and 2 columns and
    dictionary `metadata` of column headers (feature names).
