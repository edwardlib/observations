  """Cushny and Peebles Prolongation of Sleep Data

  The original data set was bivariate and recorded for ten subjects the
  prolongation of sleep caused by two different drugs. These data were
  used by Student as the first illustration of the paired t-test which
  only needs the *differences* of the two measurements. These differences
  are the values of `cushny`.

  | numeric vector, sorted increasingly:
  | 0 0.8 1 1.2 1.3 1.3 1.4 1.8 2.4 4.6

  Cushny, A.R. and Peebles, A.R. (1905) The action of optical isomers. II.
  Hyoscines. *J. Physiol.* **32**, 501â€“510.

  These data were used by Student(1908) as the first illustration of the
  paired t-test, see also `sleep`; then cited by Fisher (1925) and
  thereforth copied in numerous books as an example of a normally
  distributed sample, see, e.g., Anderson (1958).

  Args:

    path: str.
      Path to directory which either stores file or otherwise file will
      be downloaded and extracted there.
      Filename is `cushny.csv`.

  Returns:

    Tuple of np.ndarray `x_train` with 10 rows and 7 columns and
    dictionary `metadata` of column headers (feature names).
