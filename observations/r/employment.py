def employment(path):
  """Employment Status

  Data from a 1974 Danish study given by Andersen (1991) on the employees
  who had been laid off. The workers are classified by their employment
  status on 1975-01-01, the cause of their layoff and the length of
  employment before they were laid off.

  A 3-dimensional array resulting from cross-tabulating variables for 1314
  employees. The variables and their levels are as follows:

  +------+--------------------+-------------------------------------------+
  | No   | Name               | Levels                                    |
  +------+--------------------+-------------------------------------------+
  | 1    | EmploymentStatus   | NewJob, Unemployed                        |
  +------+--------------------+-------------------------------------------+
  | 2    | EmploymentLength   | <1Mo, 1-3Mo, 3-12Mo, 1-2Yr, 2-5Yr, >5Yr   |
  +------+--------------------+-------------------------------------------+
  | 3    | LayoffCause        | Closure, Replaced                         |
