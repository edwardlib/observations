  """Rat Genotype Data

  Data from a foster feeding experiment with rat mothers and litters of
  four different genotypes: `A`, `B`, `I` and `J`. Rat litters
  were separated from their natural mothers at birth and given to foster
  mothers to rear.

  The data frame has the following components:

  `Litter`
      genotype of the litter.

  `Mother`
      genotype of the foster mother.

  `Wt`
      Litter average weight gain of the litter, in grams at age 28 days.
      (The source states that the within-litter variability is
      negligible.)

  Args:

    path: str.
      Path to directory which either stores file or otherwise file will
      be downloaded and extracted there.
      Filename is `genotype.csv`.

  Returns:

    Tuple of np.ndarray `x_train` with 61 rows and 3 columns and
    dictionary `metadata` of column headers (feature names).
