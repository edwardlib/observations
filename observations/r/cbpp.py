  """Contagious bovine pleuropneumonia

  Contagious bovine pleuropneumonia (CBPP) is a major disease of cattle in
  Africa, caused by a mycoplasma. This dataset describes the serological
  incidence of CBPP in zebu cattle during a follow-up survey implemented
  in 15 commercial herds located in the Boji district of Ethiopia. The
  goal of the survey was to study the within-herd spread of CBPP in newly
  infected herds. Blood samples were quarterly collected from all animals
  of these herds to determine their CBPP status. These data were used to
  compute the serological incidence of CBPP (new cases occurring during a
  given time period). Some data are missing (lost to follow-up).

  A data frame with 56 observations on the following 4 variables.

  `herd`
      A factor identifying the herd (1 to 15).

  `incidence`
      The number of new serological cases for a given herd and time
      period.

  `size`
      A numeric vector describing herd size at the beginning of a given
      time period.

  `period`
      A factor with levels `1` to `4`.
