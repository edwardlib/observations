  """U.S. Supreme Court Vote Matrix

  This dataframe contains a matrix votes cast by U.S. Supreme Court
  justices in all cases in the 2000 term.

  The dataframe has contains data for justices Rehnquist, Stevens,
  O'Connor, Scalia, Kennedy, Souter, Thomas, Ginsburg, and Breyer for the
  2000 term of the U.S. Supreme Court. It contains data from 43
  non-unanimous cases. The votes are coded liberal (1) and conservative
  (0) using the protocol of Spaeth (2003). The unit of analysis is the
  case citation (ANALU=0). We are concerned with formally decided cases
  issued with written opinions, after full oral argument and cases decided
  by an equally divided vote (DECTYPE=1,5,6,7).
