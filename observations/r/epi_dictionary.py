  """Eysenck Personality Inventory (EPI) data for 3570 participants

  The EPI is and has been a very frequently administered personality test
  with 57 measuring two broad dimensions, Extraversion-Introversion and
  Stability-Neuroticism, with an additional Lie scale. Developed by
  Eysenck and Eysenck, 1964. Eventually replaced with the EPQ which
  measures three broad dimensions. This data set represents 3570
  observations collected in the early 1990s at the Personality, Motivation
  and Cognition lab at Northwestern. The data are included here as
  demonstration of scale construction.
