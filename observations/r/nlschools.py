  """Eighth-Grade Pupils in the Netherlands

  Snijders and Bosker (1999) use as a running example a study of 2287
  eighth-grade pupils (aged about 11) in 132 classes in 131 schools in the
  Netherlands. Only the variables used in our examples are supplied.

  This data frame contains 2287 rows and the following columns:

  `lang`
      language test score.

  `IQ`
      verbal IQ.

  `class`
      class ID.

  `GS`
      class size: number of eighth-grade pupils recorded in the class
      (there may be others: see `COMB`, and some may have been omitted
      with missing values).

  `SES`
      social-economic status of pupil's family.

  `COMB`
      were the pupils taught in a multi-grade class (`0/1`)? Classes
      which contained pupils from grades 7 and 8 are coded `1`, but only
      eighth-graders were tested.
