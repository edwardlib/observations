  The data set from Daedalus project.

  A data frame with 28 observations on the following 3 variables.

  wattsPerKg
      a numeric vector: watts per kilogram of body weight

  o2
      a numeric vector: ml/min/kg

  id
      a factor with levels 1 - 5 (`humanpower1`) or 1 - 4
      (`humanpower2`), identifying the different athletes
