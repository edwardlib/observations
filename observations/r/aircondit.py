  """Failures of Air-conditioning Equipment

  Proschan (1963) reported on the times between failures of the
  air-conditioning equipment in 10 Boeing 720 aircraft. The `aircondit`
  data frame contains the intervals for the ninth aircraft while
  `aircondit7` contains those for the seventh aircraft.

  Both data frames have just one column. Note that the data have been
  sorted into increasing order.

  The data frames contain the following column:

  `hours`
      The time interval in hours between successive failures of the
      air-conditioning equipment

  The data were taken from

  Cox, D.R. and Snell, E.J. (1981) *Applied Statistics: Principles and
  Examples*. Chapman and Hall.

  Args:

    path: str.
      Path to directory which either stores file or otherwise file will
      be downloaded and extracted there.
      Filename is `aircondit.csv`.

  Returns:

    Tuple of np.ndarray `x_train` with 12 rows and 1 columns and
    dictionary `metadata` of column headers (feature names).
