  respondents to the 2000 Current Population Survey (CPS). The states

  A data frame containing 7 variables ("state", "year", "vote", "income",
  "education", "age", "female") and 1500 observations.

  `state`
      a factor variable with levels equal to "AR" (Arkansas) and "SC"
      (South Carolina)

  `year`
      an integer vector

  `vote`
      an integer vector taking on values "1" (Voted) and "0" (Did Not
      Vote)

  `income`
      an integer vector ranging from "4" (Less than \\$5000) to "17"
      (Greater than \\$75000) denoting family income. See the CPS codebook
      for more information on variable coding

  `education`
      an integer vector ranging from "1" (Less than High School Education)
      to "4" (More than a College Education). See the CPS codebook for
      more information on variable coding
