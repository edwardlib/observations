  """Video Lottery Terminal Data

  Data on objects appearing in three windows on a video lottery terminal,
  together with the prize payout (usually 0). Observations were taken on
  two successive days in late 1994 at a hotel lounge north of Winnipeg,
  Manitoba. Each observation cost 25 cents (Canadian). The game played was
  ‘Double Diamond’.

  This data frame contains the following columns:

  window1
      object appearing in the first window.

  window2
      object appearing in the second window.

  window3
      object appearing in the third window.

  prize
      cash prize awarded (in Canadian dollars).

  night
      1, if observation was taken on day 1; 2, if observation was taken on
      day 2.
