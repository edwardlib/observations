def dwyer(path):
  """8 cognitive variables used by Dwyer for an example.

  Dwyer (1937) introduced a technique for factor extension and used 8
  cognitive variables from Thurstone. This is the example data set used in
  his paper.

  The format is: num [1:8, 1:8] 1 0.58 -0.28 0.01 0.36 0.38 0.61 0.15 0.58
  1 ... - attr(\*, "dimnames")=List of 2 ..$ : chr [1:8] "V1" "V2" "V3"
  "V4" ... ..$ : chr [1:8] "V1" "V2" "V3" "V4" ...

  Data matrix retyped from the original publication.

  Args:

    path: str.
      Path to directory which either stores file or otherwise file will
      be downloaded and extracted there.
      Filename is `dwyer.csv`.

  Returns:

    Tuple of np.ndarray `x_train` with 8 rows and 8 columns and
    dictionary `metadata` of column headers (feature names).
