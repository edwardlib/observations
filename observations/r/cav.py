  """Position of Muscle Caveolae

  The `cav` data frame has 138 rows and 2 columns.

  The data gives the positions of the individual caveolae in a square
  region with sides of length 500 units. This grid was originally on a
  2.65mum square of muscle fibre. The data are those points falling in the
  lower left hand quarter of the region used for the dataset
  `caveolae.dat` in the spatial package by B.D. Ripley (1994).

  This data frame contains the following columns:

  `x`
      The x coordinate of the caveola's position in the region.

  `y`
      The y coordinate of the caveola's position in the region.

  Args:

    path: str.
      Path to directory which either stores file or otherwise file will
      be downloaded and extracted there.
      Filename is `cav.csv`.

  Returns:

    Tuple of np.ndarray `x_train` with 138 rows and 2 columns and
    dictionary `metadata` of column headers (feature names).
