  """Kiwi Shading Data

  The `kiwishade` data frame has 48 rows and 4 columns. The data are
  from a designed experiment that compared different kiwifruit shading
  treatments. There are four vines in each plot, and four plots (one for
  each of four treatments: none, Aug2Dec, Dec2Feb, and Feb2May) in each of
  three blocks (locations: west, north, east). Each plot has the same
  number of vines, each block has the same number of plots, with each
  treatment occurring the same number of times.

  This data frame contains the following columns:

  yield
      Total yield (in kg)

  plot
      a factor with levels `east.Aug2Dec`, `east.Dec2Feb`,
      `east.Feb2May`, `east.none`, `north.Aug2Dec`,
      `north.Dec2Feb`, `north.Feb2May`, `north.none`,
      `west.Aug2Dec`, `west.Dec2Feb`, `west.Feb2May`, `west.none`

  block
      a factor indicating the location of the plot with levels `east`,
      `north`, `west`

  shade
      a factor representing the period for which the experimenter placed
      shading over the vines; with levels: `none` no shading,
      `Aug2Dec` August - December, `Dec2Feb` December - February,
      `Feb2May` February - May
