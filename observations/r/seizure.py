  The `seizure` data frame has 59 rows and 7 columns. The dataset has
  the number of epiliptic seizures in each of four two-week intervals, and
  in a baseline eight-week inverval, for treatment and control groups with
  a total of 59 individuals.

  This data frame contains the following columns:

  y1
      the number of epiliptic seizures in the 1st 2-week interval

  y2
      the number of epiliptic seizures in the 2nd 2-week interval

  y3
      the number of epiliptic seizures in the 3rd 2-week interval

  y4
      the number of epiliptic seizures in the 4th 2-week interval

  trt
      an indicator of treatment

  base
      the number of epilitic seizures in a baseline 8-week interval

  age
      a numeric vector of subject age
