  """9 Cognitive variables discussed by Tucker and Lewis (1973)

  Tucker and Lewis (1973) introduced a reliability coefficient for ML
  factor analysis. Their example data set was previously reported by
  Tucker (1958) and taken from Thurstone and Thurstone (1941). The
  correlation matrix is a 9 x 9 for 710 subjects and has two correlated
  factors of ability: Word Fluency and Verbal.

  A data frame with 9 observations on the following 9 variables.

  `t42`
      Prefixes

  `t54`
      Suffixes

  `t45`
      Chicago Reading Test: Vocabulary

  `t46`
      Chicago Reading Test: Sentences

  `t23`
      First and last letters

  `t24`
      First letters

  `t27`
      Four letter words

  `t10`
      Completion

  `t51`
      Same or Opposite
