  """Seizure Counts for Epileptics

  Thall and Vail (1990) give a data set on two-week seizure counts for 59
  epileptics. The number of seizures was recorded for a baseline period of
  8 weeks, and then patients were randomly assigned to a treatment group
  or a control group. Counts were then recorded for four successive
  two-week periods. The subject's age is the only covariate.

  This data frame has 236 rows and the following 9 columns:

  `y`
      the count for the 2-week period.

  `trt`
      treatment, `"placebo"` or `"progabide"`.

  `base`
      the counts in the baseline 8-week period.

  `age`
      subject's age, in years.

  `V4`
      `0/1` indicator variable of period 4.

  `subject`
      subject number, 1 to 59.

  `period`
      period, 1 to 4.

  `lbase`
      log-counts for the baseline period, centred to have zero mean.

  `lage`
      log-ages, centred to have zero mean.

  Args:

    path: str.
      Path to directory which either stores file or otherwise file will
      be downloaded and extracted there.
      Filename is `epil.csv`.

  Returns:

    Tuple of np.ndarray `x_train` with 236 rows and 9 columns and
    dictionary `metadata` of column headers (feature names).
