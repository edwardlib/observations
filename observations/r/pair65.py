  """Heated Elastic Bands

  The `pair65` data frame has 9 rows and 2 columns. Eighteen elastic
  bands were divided into nine pairs, with bands of similar stretchiness
  placed in the same pair. One member of each pair was placed in hot water
  (60-65 degrees C) for four minutes, while the other was left at ambient
  temperature. After a wait of about ten minutes, the amounts of stretch,
  under a 1.35 kg weight, were recorded.

  This data frame contains the following columns:

  heated
      a numeric vector giving the stretch lengths for the heated bands

  ambient
      a numeric vector giving the stretch lengths for the unheated bands

  Args:

    path: str.
      Path to directory which either stores file or otherwise file will
      be downloaded and extracted there.
      Filename is `pair65.csv`.

  Returns:

    Tuple of np.ndarray `x_train` with 9 rows and 2 columns and
    dictionary `metadata` of column headers (feature names).
