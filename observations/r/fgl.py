  """Measurements of Forensic Glass Fragments

  The `fgl` data frame has 214 rows and 10 columns. It was collected by
  B. German on fragments of glass collected in forensic work.

  This data frame contains the following columns:

  `RI`
      refractive index; more precisely the refractive index is 1.518xxxx.

      The next 8 measurements are percentages by weight of oxides.

  `Na`
      sodium.

  `Mg`
      manganese.

  `Al`
      aluminium.

  `Si`
      silicon.

  `K`
      potassium.

  `Ca`
      calcium.

  `Ba`
      barium.

  `Fe`
      iron.

  `type`
      The fragments were originally classed into seven types, one of which
      was absent in this dataset. The categories which occur are window
      float glass (`WinF`: 70), window non-float glass (`WinNF`: 76),
      vehicle window glass (`Veh`: 17), containers (`Con`: 13),
      tableware (`Tabl`: 9) and vehicle headlamps (`Head`: 29).

  Args:

    path: str.
      Path to directory which either stores file or otherwise file will
      be downloaded and extracted there.
      Filename is `fgl.csv`.

  Returns:

    Tuple of np.ndarray `x_train` with 214 rows and 10 columns and
    dictionary `metadata` of column headers (feature names).
