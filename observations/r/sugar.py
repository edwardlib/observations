  """Sugar Data

  The `sugar` data frame has 12 rows and 2 columns. They are from an
  experiment that compared an unmodified wild type plant with three
  different genetically modified forms. The measurements are weights of
  sugar that were obtained by breaking down the cellulose.

  This data frame contains the following columns:

  weight
      weight, in mg

  trt
      a factor with levels `Control` i.e. unmodified Wild form, `A`
      Modified 1, `B` Modified 2, `C` Modified 3

      Filename is `sugar.csv`.

  Returns:

    Tuple of np.ndarray `x_train` with 12 rows and 2 columns and
    dictionary `metadata` of column headers (feature names).
