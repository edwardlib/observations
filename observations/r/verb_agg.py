  """Verbal Aggression item responses

  These are the item responses to a questionaire on verbal aggression.
  These data are used throughout De Boeck and Wilson, *Explanatory Item
  Response Models* (Springer, 2004) to illustrate various forms of item
  response models.

  A data frame with 7584 observations on the following 13 variables.

  `Anger`
      the subject's Trait Anger score as measured on the State-Trait Anger
      Expression Inventory (STAXI)

  `Gender`
      the subject's gender - a factor with levels `M` and `F`

  `item`
      the item on the questionaire, as a factor

  `resp`
      the subject's response to the item - an ordered factor with levels
      `no` < `perhaps` < `yes`

  `id`
      the subject identifier, as a factor

  `btype`
      behavior type - a factor with levels `curse`, `scold` and
      `shout`

  `situ`
      situation type - a factor with levels `other` and `self`
      indicating other-to-blame and self-to-blame

  `mode`
      behavior mode - a factor with levels `want` and `do`

  `r2`
      dichotomous version of the response - a factor with levels `N` and
      `Y`
