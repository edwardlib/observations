  """Hawaian island chain hotspot Potassium-Argon ages

  K-Ar Ages (millions of years) and distances (km) from Kilauea along the
  trend of the chain of Hawaian volcanic islands and other seamounts that
  are believed to have been created by a moving "hot spot". The age of
  Kilauea is given as 0-0.4 Ma.

  A data frame with 36 observations on the following 6 variables.

  `ID`
      Volcano identifier

  `name`
      Name

  `distance`
      Distance in kilometers

  `age`
      K-Ar age in millions of years

  `error`
      Standard error of estimate?

  `source`
      Data source; see information on web site below.

  http://www.soest.hawaii.edu/GG/HCV/haw_formation.html

    Tuple of np.ndarray `x_train` with 35 rows and 6 columns and
    dictionary `metadata` of column headers (feature names).
