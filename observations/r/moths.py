  """Moths Data

  The `moths` data frame has 41 rows and 4 columns. These data are from
  a study of the effect of habitat on the densities of two species of moth
  (A and P). Transects were set across the search area. Within transects,
  sections were identified according to habitat type.

  This data frame contains the following columns:

  meters
      length of transect

  A
      number of type A moths found

  P
      number of type P moths found

  habitat
      a factor with levels `Bank`, `Disturbed`, `Lowerside`,
      `NEsoak`, `NWsoak`, `SEsoak`, `SWsoak`, `Upperside`
