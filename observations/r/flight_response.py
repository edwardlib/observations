  """FlightResponse

  Flight Response of Pacific Brant

  A dataset with 464 observations on the following 7 variables.

  `FlockID`

  Flock ID

  `Altitude`

  Altitude of the overflight by the helicopter (in 100m)

  `Lateral`

  Lateral distance (in 100m) between the aircraft and flock

  `Flight`

  `1`\ =more than 10% of flock flies away or `0`\ =otherwise

  `AltLat`

  Product of Altitude x Lateral

  `AltCat`

  Altitude categories: `low`\ =under 3, `mid`\ =3 to 6,
  `high`\ =over 6

  `LatCat`

  Lateral categories: `1`\ under 10 to `4`\ =over 30

  Data come from the book Statistical Case Studies: A Collaboration
  Between Academe and Industry, Roxy Peck, Larry D. Haugh, and Arnold
