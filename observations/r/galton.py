  """Galton's data on the heights of parents and their children

  Galton (1886) presented these data in a table, showing a
  cross-tabulation of 928 adult children born to 205 fathers and mothers,
  by their height and their mid-parent's height. He visually smoothed the
  bivariate frequency distribution and showed that the contours formed
  concentric and similar ellipses, thus setting the stage for correlation,
  regression and the bivariate normal distribution.

  A data frame with 928 observations on the following 2 variables.

  `parent`
      a numeric vector: height of the mid-parent (average of father and
      mother)

  `child`
      a numeric vector: height of the child

  Args:

    path: str.
      Path to directory which either stores file or otherwise file will
      be downloaded and extracted there.
      Filename is `galton.csv`.

  Returns:

    Tuple of np.ndarray `x_train` with 898 rows and 6 columns and
    dictionary `metadata` of column headers (feature names).
