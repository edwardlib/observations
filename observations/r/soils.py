  """Soil Compositions of Physical and Chemical Characteristics

  Soil characteristics were measured on samples from three types of
  contours (Top, Slope, and Depression) and at four depths (0-10cm,
  10-30cm, 30-60cm, and 60-90cm). The area was divided into 4 blocks, in a
  randomized block design. (Suggested by Michael Friendly.)

  A data frame with 48 observations on the following 14 variables. There
  are 3 factors and 9 response variables.

  `Group`
      a factor with 12 levels, corresponding to the combinations of
      `Contour` and `Depth`

  `Contour`
      a factor with 3 levels: `Depression` `Slope` `Top`

  `Depth`
      a factor with 4 levels: `0-10` `10-30` `30-60` `60-90`

  `Gp`
      a factor with 12 levels, giving abbreviations for the groups: `D0`
      `D1` `D3` `D6` `S0` `S1` `S3` `S6` `T0` `T1`
      `T3` `T6`

  `Block`
      a factor with levels `1` `2` `3` `4`

  `pH`
      soil pH

  `N`
      total nitrogen in %

  `Dens`
      bulk density in gm/cm$^3$

  `P`
      total phosphorous in ppm

  `Ca`
      calcium in me/100 gm.

  `Mg`
      magnesium in me/100 gm.

  `K`
      phosphorous in me/100 gm.

  `Na`
      sodium in me/100 gm.

  `Conduc`
      conductivity
