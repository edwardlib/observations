  """Neurotransmission in Guinea Pig Brains

  The `paulsen` data frame has 346 rows and 1 columns.

  Sections were prepared from the brain of adult guinea pigs. Spontaneous
  currents that flowed into individual brain cells were then recorded and
  the peak amplitude of each current measured. The aim of the experiment
  was to see if the current flow was quantal in nature (i.e. that it is
  not a single burst but instead is built up of many smaller bursts of
  current). If the current was indeed quantal then it would be expected
  that the distribution of the current amplitude would be multimodal with
  modes at regular intervals. The modes would be expected to decrease in
  magnitude for higher current amplitudes.

  This data frame contains the following column:

  `y`
      The current flowing into individual brain cells. The currents are
      measured in pico-amperes.

  The data were kindly made available by Dr. O. Paulsen from the
  Department of Pharmacology at the University of Oxford.
