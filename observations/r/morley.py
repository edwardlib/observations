  """Michelson Speed of Light Data

  A classical data of Michelson (but not this one with Morley) on
  measurements done in 1879 on the speed of light. The data consists of
  five experiments, each consisting of 20 consecutive ‘runs’. The response
  is the speed of light measurement, suitably coded (km/sec, with
  `299000` subtracted).

  A data frame with 100 observations on the following 3 variables.

  `Expt`
      The experiment number, from 1 to 5.

  `Run`
      The run number within each experiment.

  `Speed`
      Speed-of-light measurement.

  Details
  ~~~~~~~

  The data is here viewed as a randomized block experiment with
  ‘experiment’ and ‘run’ as the factors. ‘run’ may also be considered a
  quantitative variate to account for linear (or polynomial) changes in
  the measurement over the course of a single experiment.
