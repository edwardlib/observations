  """CoolingWater

  Temperature of a mug of water as it cools

  A data frame with 222 observations of the following variables.

  -  `time` time in minutes

  -  `temp` temperature in Celsius

  These data were collected Stan Wagon to help his mathematical modeling
  students explore Newton's Law of Cooling and the ways that the law is
  really only an approximation. More about Stan: http://stanwagon.com.

  Args:

    path: str.
      Path to directory which either stores file or otherwise file will
      be downloaded and extracted there.
      Filename is `cooling_water.csv`.

  Returns:

    Tuple of np.ndarray `x_train` with 222 rows and 2 columns and
    dictionary `metadata` of column headers (feature names).
