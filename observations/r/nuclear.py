  """Nuclear Power Station Construction Data

  The `nuclear` data frame has 32 rows and 11 columns.

  The data relate to the construction of 32 light water reactor (LWR)
  plants constructed in the U.S.A in the late 1960's and early 1970's. The
  data was collected with the aim of predicting the cost of construction
  of further LWR plants. 6 of the power plants had partial turnkey
  guarantees and it is possible that, for these plants, some
  manufacturers' subsidies may be hidden in the quoted capital costs.

  This data frame contains the following columns:

  `cost`
      The capital cost of construction in millions of dollars adjusted to
      1976 base.

  `date`
      The date on which the construction permit was issued. The data are
      measured in years since January 1 1990 to the nearest month.

  `t1`
      The time between application for and issue of the construction
      permit.

  `t2`
      The time between issue of operating license and construction permit.

  `cap`
      The net capacity of the power plant (MWe).

  `pr`
      A binary variable where `1` indicates the prior existence of a LWR
      plant at the same site.

  `ne`
      A binary variable where `1` indicates that the plant was
      constructed in the north-east region of the U.S.A.

  `ct`
      A binary variable where `1` indicates the use of a cooling tower
      in the plant.

  `bw`
      A binary variable where `1` indicates that the nuclear steam
      supply system was manufactured by Babcock-Wilcox.

  `cum.n`
      The cumulative number of power plants constructed by each
      architect-engineer.

  `pt`
      A binary variable where `1` indicates those plants with partial
      turnkey guarantees.

  The data were obtained from

  Cox, D.R. and Snell, E.J. (1981) *Applied Statistics: Principles and
  Examples*. Chapman and Hall.
