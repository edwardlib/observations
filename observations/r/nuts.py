  Squirrel data set (nuts) from Zuur, Hilbe, and Ieno (2013). As
  originally reported by Flaherty et al (2012), researchers recorded
  information about squirrel behavior and forest attributes across various
  plots in Scotland's Abernathy Forest. The study focused on the following
  variables. response cones number of cones stripped by red squirrels per
  plot predictor sntrees standardized number of trees per plot sheight
  standardized mean tree height per plot scover standardized percentage of
  canopy cover per plot The stripped cone count was only taken when the
  mean diameter of trees was under 0.6m (dbh).

  A data frame with 52 observations on the following 8 variables.

  `cones`
      number cones stripped by squirrels

  `ntrees`
      number of trees per plot

  `dbh`
      number DBH per plot

  `height`
      mean tree height per plot

  `cover`
      canopy closure (as a percentage)

  `sntrees`
      standardized number of trees per plot

  `sheight`
      standardized mean tree height per plot

  `scover`
      standardized canopy closure (as a percentage)
