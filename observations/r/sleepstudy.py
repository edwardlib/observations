  """Reaction times in a sleep deprivation study

  The average reaction time per day for subjects in a sleep deprivation
  study. On day 0 the subjects had their normal amount of sleep. Starting
  that night they were restricted to 3 hours of sleep per night. The
  observations represent the average reaction time on a series of tests
  given each day to each subject.

  A data frame with 180 observations on the following 3 variables.

  `Reaction`
      Average reaction time (ms)

  `Days`
      Number of days of sleep deprivation

  `Subject`
      Subject number on which the observation was made.

  Args:

    path: str.
      Path to directory which either stores file or otherwise file will
      be downloaded and extracted there.
      Filename is `sleepstudy.csv`.

  Returns:

    Tuple of np.ndarray `x_train` with 180 rows and 3 columns and
    dictionary `metadata` of column headers (feature names).
