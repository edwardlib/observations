def union_density(path):
  """cross national rates of trade union density

  Cross-national data on relative size of the trade unions and predictors,
  in 20 countries. Two of the predictors are highly collinear, and are the
  source of a debate between Stephens and Wallerstein (1991), later
  reviewed by Western and Jackman (1994).

  -  `union`\ numeric, percentage of the total number of wage and salary
     earners plus the unemployed who are union members, measured between
     1975 and 1980, with most of the data drawn from 1979

  -  `left`\ numeric, an index tapping the extent to which parties of
     the left have controlled governments since 1919, due to Wilensky
     (1981).

  -  `size`\ numeric, log of labor force size, defined as the number of
     wage and salary earners, plus the unemployed

  -  `concen`\ numeric, percentage of employment, shipments, or
     production accounted for by the four largest enterprises in a
     particular industry, averaged over industries (with weights
     proportional to the size of the industry) and the resulting measure
     is normalized such that the United States scores a 1.0, and is due to
     Pryor (1973). Some of the scores on this variable are imputed using
     procedures described in Stephens and Wallerstein (1991, 945).
