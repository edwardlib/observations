  """Variation in penicillin testing

  Six samples of penicillin were tested using the *B. subtilis* plate
  method on each of 24 plates. The response is the diameter (mm) of the
  zone of inhibition of growth of the organism.

  A data frame with 144 observations on the following 3 variables.

  `diameter`
      diameter (mm) of the zone of inhibition of the growth of the
      organism.

  `plate`
      assay plate. A factor with levels ‘a’ to ‘x’.

  `sample`
      penicillin sample. A factor with levels ‘A’ to ‘F’.

  Args:

    path: str.
      Path to directory which either stores file or otherwise file will
      be downloaded and extracted there.
      Filename is `penicillin.csv`.

  Returns:

    Tuple of np.ndarray `x_train` with 144 rows and 3 columns and
