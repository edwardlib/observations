  """Failure Time of PET Film

  The `hirose` data frame has 44 rows and 3 columns.

  PET film is used in electrical insulation. In this accelerated life test
  the failure times for 44 samples in gas insulated transformers. 4
  different voltage levels were used.

  This data frame contains the following columns:

  `volt`
      The voltage (in kV).

  `time`
      The failure or censoring time in hours.

  `cens`
      The censoring indicator; `1` means right-censored data.

  The data were obtained from

  Hirose, H. (1993) Estimation of threshold stress in accelerated
  life-testing. *IEEE Transactions on Reliability*, **42**, 650â€“657.

  Args:

    path: str.
      Path to directory which either stores file or otherwise file will
      be downloaded and extracted there.
      Filename is `hirose.csv`.

  Returns:

    Tuple of np.ndarray `x_train` with 44 rows and 3 columns and
    dictionary `metadata` of column headers (feature names).
