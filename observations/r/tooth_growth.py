  """The Effect of Vitamin C on Tooth Growth in Guinea Pigs

  The response is the length of odontoblasts (cells responsible for tooth
  growth) in 60 guinea pigs. Each animal received one of three dose levels
  of vitamin C (0.5, 1, and 2 mg/day) by one of two delivery methods,
  (orange juice or ascorbic acid (a form of vitamin C and coded as
  `VC`).

  A data frame with 60 observations on 3 variables.
