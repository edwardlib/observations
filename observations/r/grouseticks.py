  `INDEX`
      (factor) chick number (observation level)

  `TICKS`
      number of ticks sampled

  `BROOD`
      (factor) brood number

  `HEIGHT`

  `LOCATION`
      (factor) geographic location code

  `cHEIGHT`
      centered height, derived from `HEIGHT`

  `meanTICKS`
      mean number of ticks by brood

  `varTICKS`
      variance of number of ticks by brood
