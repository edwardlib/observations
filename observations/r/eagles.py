  """Foraging Ecology of Bald Eagles

  Knight and Skagen collected during a field study on the foraging
  behaviour of wintering Bald Eagles in Washington State, USA data
  concerning 160 attempts by one (pirating) Bald Eagle to steal a chum
  salmon from another (feeding) Bald Eagle.

  The `eagles` data frame has 8 rows and 5 columns.

  `y`
      Number of successful attempts.

  `n`
      Total number of attempts.

  `P`
      Size of pirating eagle (`L` = large, `S` = small).

  `A`
      Age of pirating eagle (`I` = immature, `A` = adult).

  `V`
      Size of victim eagle (`L` = large, `S` = small).

  Knight, R. L. and Skagen, S. K. (1988) Agonistic asymmetries and the
  foraging ecology of Bald Eagles. *Ecology* **69**, 1188â€“1194.

  Args:

    path: str.
      Path to directory which either stores file or otherwise file will
      be downloaded and extracted there.
      Filename is `eagles.csv`.

  Returns:

    Tuple of np.ndarray `x_train` with 8 rows and 5 columns and
    dictionary `metadata` of column headers (feature names).
