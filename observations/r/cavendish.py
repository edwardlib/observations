  """Cavendish's Determinations of the Density of the Earth

  Henry Cavendish carried out a series of experiments in 1798 to determine
  the mean density of the earth, as an indirect means to calculate the
  gravitational constant, G, in Newton's formula for the force (f) of
  gravitational attraction, *f = G m M / r^2* between two bodies of mass m
  and M.

  Stigler (1977) used these data to illustrate properties of robust
  estimators with real, historical data. For these data sets, he found
  that trimmed means performed as well or better than more elaborate
  robust estimators.

  A data frame with 29 observations on the following 3 variables.

  `density`
      Cavendish's 29 determinations of the mean density of the earth

  `density2`
      same as `density`, with the third value (4.88) replaced by 5.88

  `density3`
      same as `density`, omitting the the first 6 observations
