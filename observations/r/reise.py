  """Seven data sets showing a bifactor solution.

  Holzinger-Swineford (1937) introduced the bifactor model of a general
  factor and uncorrelated group factors. The Holzinger data sets are
  original 14 \* 14 matrix from their paper as well as a 9 \*9 matrix used
  as an example by Joreskog. The Thurstone correlation matrix is a 9 \* 9
  matrix of correlations of ability items. The Reise data set is 16 \* 16
  correlation matrix of mental health items. The Bechtholdt data sets are
  both 17 x 17 correlation matrices of ability tests.
