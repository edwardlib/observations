  """Example Data for the Design Functions

  A random subsample of the simulated data used in Imai, Tingley, Yamamoto
  (2012). The data contains 1000 rows and 7 columns with no missing
  values.

  A data frame containing the following variables, which are interpreted
  as results from a hypothetical randomized trial. See the source for a
  full description.

  out:
      The binary outcome variable under the parallel design.

  out.enc:
      The binary outcome variable under the parallel encouragement design.

  med:
      The binary mediator under the parallel design.

  med.enc:
      The binary mediator under the parallel encouragement design.

  ttt:
      The binary treatment variable.

  manip:
      The design indicator, or the variable indicating whether the
      mediator is manipulated under the parallel design.

  enc:
      The trichotomous encouragement variable under the parallel
      encouragement design. Equals 0 if subject received no encouragement;
      1 if encouraged for the mediator value of 1; and -1 if encouraged
      for the mediator value of 0.

  Args:

    path: str.
      Path to directory which either stores file or otherwise file will
      be downloaded and extracted there.
      Filename is `boundsdata.csv`.

  Returns:

    Tuple of np.ndarray `x_train` with 1000 rows and 7 columns and
    dictionary `metadata` of column headers (feature names).
