  """Edgeworth's counts of dactyls in Virgil's Aeneid

  Edgeworth (1885) took the first 75 lines in Book XI of Virgil's *Aeneid*
  and classified each of the first four "feet" of the line as a dactyl
  (one long syllable followed by two short ones) or not.

  Grouping the lines in blocks of five gave a 4 x 25 table of counts,
  represented here as a data frame with ordered factors, `Foot` and
  `Lines`. Edgeworth used this table in what was among the first
  examples of analysis of variance applied to a two-way classification.

  A data frame with 60 observations on the following 3 variables.

  `Foot`
      an ordered factor with levels `1` < `2` < `3` < `4`

  `Lines`
      an ordered factor with levels `1:5` < `6:10` < `11:15` <
      `16:20` < `21:25` < `26:30` < `31:35` < `36:40` <
      `41:45` < `46:50` < `51:55` < `56:60` < `61:65` <
      `66:70` < `71:75`

  `count`
      number of dactyls

  Args:

    path: str.
      Path to directory which either stores file or otherwise file will
      be downloaded and extracted there.
      Filename is `dactyl.csv`.

  Returns:

    Tuple of np.ndarray `x_train` with 60 rows and 3 columns and
    dictionary `metadata` of column headers (feature names).
