  """Leaf and Air Temperature Data

  These data consist of measurements of vapour pressure and of the
  difference between leaf and air temperature.

  This data frame contains the following columns:

  CO2level
      Carbon Dioxide level `low`, `medium`, `high`

  vapPress
      Vapour pressure

  tempDiff
      Difference between leaf and air temperature

  BtempDiff
      a numeric vector

  Args:

    path: str.
      Path to directory which either stores file or otherwise file will
      be downloaded and extracted there.
      Filename is `leaftemp.csv`.

  Returns:

    Tuple of np.ndarray `x_train` with 62 rows and 4 columns and
    dictionary `metadata` of column headers (feature names).
