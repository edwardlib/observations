  """Neurophysiological Point Process Data

  `neuro` is a matrix containing times of observed firing of a neuron in
  windows of 250ms either side of the application of a stimulus to a human
  subject. Each row of the matrix is a replication of the experiment and
  there were a total of 469 replicates.

  The data were collected and kindly made available by Dr. S.J. Boniface
  of the Neurophysiology Unit at the Radcliffe Infirmary, Oxford.

  Args:

    path: str.
      Path to directory which either stores file or otherwise file will
      be downloaded and extracted there.
      Filename is `neuro.csv`.

  Returns:

    Tuple of np.ndarray `x_train` with 469 rows and 6 columns and
    dictionary `metadata` of column headers (feature names).
