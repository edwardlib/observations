  Data from Fair (1978). Although Fair used a tobit model with the data,
  the outcome measure can be modeled as a count. In fact, Greene (2003)
  modeled it as Poisson, but given the amount of overdispersion in the
  data, employing a negative binomial model is an appropriate strategy.
  The data is stored in the affairs data set. Naffairs is the response
  variable, indicating the number of affairs reported by the participant
  in the past year.

  A data frame with 601 observations on the following 18 variables.

  `naffairs`
      number of affairs within last year

  `kids`
      1=have children;0= no children

  `vryunhap`
      (1/0) very unhappily married

  `unhap`
      (1/0) unhappily married

  `avgmarr`
      (1/0) average married

  `hapavg`
      (1/0) happily married

  `vryhap`
      (1/0) very happily married

  `antirel`
      (1/0) anti religious

  `notrel`
      (1/0) not religious

  `slghtrel`
      (1/0) slightly religious

  `smerel`
      (1/0) somewhat religious

  `vryrel`
      (1/0) very religious

  `yrsmarr1`
      (1/0) >0.75 yrs

  `yrsmarr2`
      (1/0) >1.5 yrs

  `yrsmarr3`
      (1/0) >4.0 yrs

  `yrsmarr4`
      (1/0) >7.0 yrs
