  genotype frequencies for two locations, for Xavante Indian and Irish
  populations respectively

  This data frame contains the following columns:

  Population
      Factor with levels: `Indian` and `Irish`

  locus1
      Factor with levels: `MM`, `MN` and `NN`

  locus2
      Factor with levels: `SS`, `Ss` and `ss`

  Observed
      a numeric vector giving the frequency for each category of the tale

  Mourant et al (1977) and Huttley and Wilson (2000).

    Tuple of np.ndarray `x_train` with 18 rows and 4 columns and
    dictionary `metadata` of column headers (feature names).
