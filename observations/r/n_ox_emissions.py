  """NOx Air Pollution Data

  A typical medium sized environmental data set with hourly measurements
  of *NOx* pollution content in the ambient air.

  A data frame with 8088 observations on the following 4 variables.

  `julday`
      day number, a factor with levels `373` ... `730`, typically with
      24 hourly measurements.

  `LNOx`
      *\\log* of hourly mean of NOx concentration in ambient air [ppb]
      next to a highly frequented motorway.

  `LNOxEm`
      *\\log* of hourly sum of NOx emission of cars on this motorway in
      arbitrary units.

  `sqrtWS`
      Square root of wind speed [m/s].

  Args:

    path: str.

      be downloaded and extracted there.
      Filename is `n_ox_emissions.csv`.

  Returns:

    Tuple of np.ndarray `x_train` with 8088 rows and 4 columns and
    dictionary `metadata` of column headers (feature names).
