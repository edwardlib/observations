  """12 variables created by Schmid and Leiman to show the Schmid-Leiman Transf
  ormation

  John Schmid and John M. Leiman (1957) discuss how to transform a
  hierarchical factor structure to a bifactor structure. Schmid contains
  the example 12 x 12 correlation matrix. schmid.leiman is a 12 x 12
  correlation matrix with communalities on the diagonal. This can be used
  to show the effect of correcting for attenuation. Two additional data
  sets are taken from Chen et al. (2006).
