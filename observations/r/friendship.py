  """Simulated Example of Schoolchildren Friendship Network

  This data set contains six sociomatrices of simulated data on friendship
  ties among schoolchildren.

  Each variable in the dataset is a 15 by 15 matrix representing some form
  of social network tie held by the fictitious children. The matrices are
  labeled "friends", "advice", "prestige", "authority", "perpower" and
  "per".

  The sociomatrices were combined into the friendship dataset using the
  format.network.data function from the netglm package by Skyler Cranmer
  as shown in the example.
