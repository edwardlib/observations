  """Calcium Uptake Data

  The `calcium` data frame has 27 rows and 2 columns.

  Howard Grimes from the Botany Department, North Carolina State
  University, conducted an experiment for biochemical analysis of
  intracellular storage and transport of calcium across plasma membrane.
  Cells were suspended in a solution of radioactive calcium for a certain
  length of time and then the amount of radioactive calcium that was
  absorbed by the cells was measured. The experiment was repeated
  independently with 9 different times of suspension each replicated 3
  times.

  This data frame contains the following columns:

  `time`
      The time (in minutes) that the cells were suspended in the solution.

  `cal`
      The amount of calcium uptake (nmoles/mg).

  The data were obtained from

  Rawlings, J.O. (1988) *Applied Regression Analysis*. Wadsworth and
  Brooks/Cole Statistics/Probability Series.

  Args:

    path: str.
      Path to directory which either stores file or otherwise file will
      be downloaded and extracted there.
      Filename is `calcium.csv`.

  Returns:

    Tuple of np.ndarray `x_train` with 27 rows and 2 columns and
    dictionary `metadata` of column headers (feature names).
