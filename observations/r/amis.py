  """Car Speeding and Warning Signs

  The `amis` data frame has 8437 rows and 4 columns.

  In a study into the effect that warning signs have on speeding patterns,
  Cambridgeshire County Council considered 14 pairs of locations. The
  locations were paired to account for factors such as traffic volume and
  type of road. One site in each pair had a sign erected warning of the
  dangers of speeding and asking drivers to slow down. No action was taken
  at the second site. Three sets of measurements were taken at each site.
  Each set of measurements was nominally of the speeds of 100 cars but not
  all sites have exactly 100 measurements. These speed measurements were
  taken before the erection of the sign, shortly after the erection of the
  sign, and again after the sign had been in place for some time.

  This data frame contains the following columns:

  `speed`
      Speeds of cars (in miles per hour).

  `period`
      A numeric column indicating the time that the reading was taken. A
      value of 1 indicates a reading taken before the sign was erected, a
      2 indicates a reading taken shortly after erection of the sign and a
      3 indicates a reading taken after the sign had been in place for
      some time.

  `warning`
      A numeric column indicating whether the location of the reading was
      chosen to have a warning sign erected. A value of 1 indicates
      presence of a sign and a value of 2 indicates that no sign was
      erected.

  `pair`
      A numeric column giving the pair number at which the reading was
      taken. Pairs were numbered from 1 to 14.

  The data were kindly made available by Mr. Graham Amis, Cambridgeshire
  County Council, U.K.
