  Data are taken from Loomis (2003). The study relates to a survey taken
  on reported frequency of visits to national parks during the year. The
  survey was taken at park sites, thus incurring possible effects of
  endogenous stratification.

  A data frame with 410 observations on the following 11 variables.

  `anvisits`
      number of annual visits to park

  `gender`
      1=male;0=female

  `income`
      income in US dollars per year, categorical: 4 levels

  `income1`
      <=$25000

  `income2`
      >$25000 - $55000

  `income3`
      >$55000 - $95000

  `income4`
      >$95000

  `travel`
      travel time, categorical: 3 levels

  `travel1`
      <.25 hrs

  `travel2`
      >=.25 - <4 hrs

  `travel3`
      >=4 hrs
