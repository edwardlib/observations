  """Toy Cars Data

  The `toycars` data frame has 27 rows and 3 columns. Observations are
  on the distance traveled by one of three different toy cars on a smooth
  surface, starting from rest at the top of a 16 inch long ramp tilted at
  varying angles.

  This data frame contains the following columns:

  angle
      tilt of ramp, in degrees

  distance
      distance traveled, in meters

  car
      a numeric code (1 = first car, 2 = second car, 3 = third car)

  Args:

    path: str.
      Path to directory which either stores file or otherwise file will
      be downloaded and extracted there.
      Filename is `toycars.csv`.

  Returns:

    Tuple of np.ndarray `x_train` with 27 rows and 3 columns and
    dictionary `metadata` of column headers (feature names).
