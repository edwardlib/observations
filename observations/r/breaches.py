  """Cyber Security Breaches

  `data.frame` of cyber security breaches involving health care records
  of 500 or more humans reported to the U.S. Department of Health and
  Human Services (HHS) as of June 27, 2014.

      Factor giving the name of a subcontractor (or blank) associated with
      the breach.

  Individuals\_Affected

      fewer.

  Date\_of\_Breach
      `character` vector giving the date or date range of the breach.
      Recodes as `Date`\ s in `breach_start` and `breach_end`.

      `factor` with 29 levels giving the type of breach (e.g., "Theft"
      vs., "Unauthorized Access/Disclosure", etc.)

  Location\_of\_Breached\_Information
      `factor` with 41 levels coding the location from which the breach
      occurred (e.g., "Paper", "Laptop", etc.)

  Date\_Posted\_or\_Updated
      `Date` the information was posted to the HHS data base or last
      updated.

  Summary
      `character` vector of a summary of the incident.

  breach\_start
      `Date` of the start of the incident = first date given in
      `Date_of_Breach` above.

  `breach_end` `Date` of the end of the incident or `NA` if only one
  date is given in `Date_of_Breach` above. `year` `integer` giving
  the year of the breach
