  """Brader, Valentino and Suhay (2008) Framing Experiment Data

  The `framing` data contains 265 rows and 15 columns of data from a
  framing experiment conducted by Brader, Valentino and Suhay (2008).

  A data frame containing the following variables:

  immigr:
      A four-point scale measuring subjects' attitudes toward increased
      immigration. Larger values indicate more negative attitudes.

  english:
      A four-point scale indicating whether subjects favor or oppose a law
      making English the official language of the U.S.

  cong\_mesg:
      Whether subjects requested sending an anti-immigration message to
      Congress on their behalf.

  anti\_info:

      organizations.

  tone:
      1st treatment; whether the news story is framed positively or
      negatively.

  eth:
      2nd treatment; whether the news story features a Latino or European
      immigrant.

  cond:
      Four level measure recording joint treatment status of tone and eth.

  treat:
      Product of the two treatment variables. In the original study the
      authors only find this cell to be significant.

  emo:
      Measure of subjects' negative feeling during the experiment. A
      numeric scale ranging between 3 and 12 where 3 indicates the most
      negative feeling.

  anx:
      A four-point scale measuring subjects' anxiety about increased
      immigration.

      Subjects' perceived harm caused by increased immigration. A numeric
