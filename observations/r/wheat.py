  """Playfair's Data on Wages and the Price of Wheat

  Playfair (1821) used a graph, showing parallel time-series of the price
  of wheat and the typical weekly wage for a "good mechanic" from 1565 to
  1821 to argue that working men had never been as well-off in terms of
  purchasing power as they had become toward the end of this period.

  His graph is a classic in the history of data visualization, but commits
  the sin of showing two non-commensurable Y variables on different axes.
  Scatterplots of wages vs. price or plots of ratios (e.g., wages/price)
  are in some ways better, but both of these ideas were unknown in 1821.

  In this version, information on the reigns of British monarchs is
  provided in a separate data.frame, `Wheat.monarch`.

  `Wheat` A data frame with 53 observations on the following 3
  variables.

  `Year`
      Year, in intervals of 5 from 1565 to 1821: a numeric vector

  `Wheat`
      Price of Wheat (Shillings/Quarter bushel): a numeric vector

  `Wages`
      Weekly wage (Shillings): a numeric vector

  `Wheat.monarchs` A data frame with 12 observations on the following 4
  variables.

  `name`
      Reigning monarch, a factor with levels `Anne` `Charles I`
      `Charles II` `Cromwell` `Elizabeth` `George I` `George II`
      `George III` `George IV` `James I` `James II` `W&M`

  `start`
      Starting year of reign, a numeric vector

  `end`
      Starting year of reign, a numeric vector

  `commonwealth`
      A binary variable indicating the period of the Commonwealth under
      Cromwell
