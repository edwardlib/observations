  """Example Data for the Crossover Encouragement Design

  A randomly generated dataset containing 2000 rows and 7 columns with no
  missing values.

  A data frame containing the following variables, which are interpreted
  as results from a hypothetical randomized trial employing the crossover
  encouragement design.

  T1:
      The binary treatment indicator in the first stage.

  M1:
      The binary mediator variable recorded in the first stage.

  Y1:
      The binary outcome variable recorded in the first stage.

  T2:
      The binary treatment in the second stage. Equal to 1 - T1 by design.

  Z:
      The binary encouragement indicator for the second stage.

  M2:
      The binary mediator recorded in the second stage.

  Y2:
      The binary outcome recorded in the second stage.
