  """Aircraft Data

  Aircraft Data, deals with 23 single-engine aircraft built over the years
  1947-1979, from Office of Naval Research. The dependent variable is cost
  (in units of \\$100,000) and the explanatory variables are aspect ratio,
  lift-to-drag ratio, weight of plane (in pounds) and maximal thrust.

  A data frame with 23 observations on the following 5 variables.

  `X1`
      Aspect Ratio

  `X2`
      Lift-to-Drag Ratio

  `X3`
      Weight

  `X4`
      Thrust

  `Y`
      Cost

  Args:

    path: str.
      Path to directory which either stores file or otherwise file will
      be downloaded and extracted there.
      Filename is `aircraft.csv`.

  Returns:

    Tuple of np.ndarray `x_train` with 23 rows and 5 columns and
    dictionary `metadata` of column headers (feature names).
