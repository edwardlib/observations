  """Survival of Rats after Radiation Doses

  The `survival` data frame has 14 rows and 2 columns.

  The data measured the survival percentages of batches of rats who were
  given varying doses of radiation. At each of 6 doses there were two or
  three replications of the experiment.

  This data frame contains the following columns:

  `dose`
      The dose of radiation administered (rads).

  `surv`
      The survival rate of the batches expressed as a percentage.

  The data were obtained from

  Efron, B. (1988) Computer-intensive methods in statistical regression.
  *SIAM Review*, **30**, 421â€“449.

  Args:

    path: str.
      Path to directory which either stores file or otherwise file will
      be downloaded and extracted there.
      Filename is `survival.csv`.

  Returns:

    Tuple of np.ndarray `x_train` with 14 rows and 2 columns and
    dictionary `metadata` of column headers (feature names).
