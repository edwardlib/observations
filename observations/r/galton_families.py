  """Galton's data on the heights of parents and their children, by child

  This data set lists the individual observations for 934 children in 205
  families on which Galton (1886) based his cross-tabulation.

  In addition to the question of the relation between heights of parents
  and their offspring, for which this data is mainly famous, Galton had
  another purpose which the data in this form allows to address: Does
  marriage selection indicate a relationship between the heights of
  husbands and wives, a topic he called *assortative mating*? Keen [p.
  297-298](2010) provides a brief discussion of this topic.

  A data frame with 934 observations on the following 8 variables.

  `family`
      family ID, a factor with levels `001`-`204`

  `father`
      height of father

  `mother`
      height of mother

  `midparentHeight`
      mid-parent height, calculated as `(father + 1.08*mother)/2`

  `children`
      number of children in this family

  `childNum`
      number of this child within family. Children are listed in
      decreasing order of height for boys followed by girls

  `gender`
      child gender, a factor with levels `female` `male`

  `childHeight`
      height of child
