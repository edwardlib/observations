  """Darwin's Plant Height Differences

  The `darwin` data frame has 15 rows and 1 columns.

  Charles Darwin conducted an experiment to examine the superiority of
  cross-fertilized plants over self-fertilized plants. 15 pairs of plants
  were used. Each pair consisted of one cross-fertilized plant and one
  self-fertilized plant which germinated at the same time and grew in the
  same pot. The plants were measured at a fixed time after planting and
  the difference in heights between the cross- and self-fertilized plants
  are recorded in eighths of an inch.

  This data frame contains the following column:

  `y`
      The difference in heights for the pairs of plants (in units of 0.125
      inches).

  The data were obtained from

  Fisher, R.A. (1935) *Design of Experiments*. Oliver and Boyd.

  Args:

    path: str.
      Path to directory which either stores file or otherwise file will
      be downloaded and extracted there.
      Filename is `darwin.csv`.

  Returns:

    Tuple of np.ndarray `x_train` with 15 rows and 1 columns and
    dictionary `metadata` of column headers (feature names).
