  """Dose-mortality data, for fumigation of codling moth with methyl bromide

  Data are from trials that studied the mortality response of codling moth
  to fumigation with methyl bromide.

  A data frame with 99 observations on the following 10 variables.

  dose
      Injected dose of methyl bromide, in gm per cubic meter

  tot
      Number of insects in chamber

  dead
      Number of insects dying

  pobs
      Proportion dying

  cm
      Control mortality, i.e., at dose 0

  ct
      Concentration-time sum

  Cultivar
      a factor with levels `BRAEBURN` `FUJI` `GRANNY` `Gala`
      `ROYAL` `Red Delicious` `Splendour`

  gp
      a factor which has a different level for each different combination
      of `Cultivar`, `year` and `rep` (replicate).

  year
      a factor with levels `1988` `1989`

  numcm
      a numeric vector: total number of control insects
